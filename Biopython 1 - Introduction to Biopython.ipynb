    "Biopython is a set of Python dools developed for common tasks in computational molecular biology. Since it is open-source, its capabilities are constantly being developed and added to. Some common utilities are:\n",
    "* Parsing bioinformatics files into usable data structures\n",
    "* Conveniently iterating over multiple data files\n",
    "* Interfacing with online resources such as ENTREZ\n",
    "* Working with sequences to perform analyses\n",
    "In this workshop, I hope you will become familiar with Biopython and its basic utilities, and that you are able to then apply when you have learned to your own research. "
