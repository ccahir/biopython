TI  - Antioxidant Activity and Seasonal Variations in the Composition of Insoluble 
      Fiber from the Cladodes of Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller: Development of New 
      Extraction Procedures to Improve Fiber Yield.
LID - 10.3390/plants13040544 [doi]
LID - 544
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller is a plant belonging to the Cactaceae family 
      adapted to live in environments characterized by long periods of drought and arid 
      or desert climates. This plant is characterized by an aerial part composed of 
      structures transformed by branches, called "cladodes", which are essential to 
      reduce excessive perspiration of water and appear covered with thorns. The 
      composition of the cladodes includes water, polysaccharides, fiber, proteins, 
      vitamins, fatty acids, sterols, polyphenols, and minerals. The main purposes of 
      this scientific work are (a) to compare the insoluble fiber (IF) extracted from 
      the cladodes of O. ficus-indica belonging to the same plant but collected in 
      different seasonal periods (winter and summer) and develop new extraction 
      protocols that are able to improve the yield obtained and (b) evaluate the 
      antioxidant potential of the fiber and study possible variations as a result of 
      the extraction protocol chosen. The first objective was achieved (1) by measuring 
      the amount of IF extracted from cladodes harvested in winter and summer (CW and 
      CS, respectively) and (2) by modifying three variables involved in the fiber 
      extraction protocol. To achieve the second objective, the following experiments 
      were carried out: (1) measurement of the antioxidant potential of IF in CW and 
      CS; (2) measurement of cellular reactive oxygen species; (3) measurement of the 
      activity of some antioxidant enzymes; and (4) comparison of the polyphenol 
      content in CW and CS. In conclusion, the results obtained showed that the IF 
      extraction process can be improved, achieving a uniform yield regardless of 
      seasonality; the antioxidant effect may vary depending on the extraction 
      protocol.

TI  - A Prospective, Multicenter, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy 
      of a Cream Containing Xyloglucan, Pea Protein, and Opuntia ficus-indica Extract 
      Versus Calcipotriol/Betamethasone in Adult Patients with Mild-to-moderate 
      Psoriasis.
PG  - 12-17
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, requiring local and 
      systemic drugs according to disease severity. This study aims to investigate the 
      efficacy and safety of a topical treatment containing xyloglucan, pea proteins 
      and Opuntia ficus-indica extracts (XPO) compared to calcipotriol 
      50mcg/betamethasone 0.5mg ointment (CB). METHODS: Forty-two patients diagnosed 
      with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis were assigned 1:1 to XPO treatment or CB 
      for 28 days. Disease status was assessed at baseline (V1), monitored every two 
      weeks (V2, V3), and at follow-up (V4). Disease severity was assessed by PASI 
      (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index), PGA (Physician's Global Assessment), and VAS 
      (Visual Analog Scale for itching). Photos were taken before and after XPO 
      treatment. Treatment efficacy was determined by comparing psoriasis severity at 
      baseline to V3. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of adverse 
      events. RESULTS: Both groups showed a statistically significant difference in 
      PASI score from V1 to V2 (p=0.001, XPO; p=0.008, CB) and to V3 (p=0.001, XPO; 
      p=0.004, CB). XPO achieved a PASI 50 score of 24 percent at V2 and 52 percent at 
      V3 compared to CB (0% at V2 and 19% at V3). At V3, PGA was significantly reduced 
      in both groups (p=0.003, XPO; p=0.001 CB). Both treatments significantly reduced 
      itching at V2 (p=0.001, XPO; p=0.003, CB) and V3 (p=0.001, XPO; p=0.0005, CB). 
      CONCLUSION: XPO showed similar efficacy to CB, significantly reducing disease 
      severity, erythema, itching, induration, and scaling with an excellent 
      tolerability profile.

TI  - Exploring the biofunctionalities of lactic fermented cactus pear (Opuntia elatior 
      Mill.) fruit beverage: an exotic superfood.
PG  - 969-982
LID - 10.1007/s13197-023-05893-y [doi]
AB  - Cactus pear fruit is known with many health benefits in ethnomedicine of 
      countries like Mexico, Portugal, Chine, India etc. The study was aimed to develop 
      biofunctional lactic fermented cactus pear fruit beverage to add values to the 
      medicinal fruit. The processing parameters such as quantity of freeze dried 
      cactus pear fruit powder, sucrose and incubation time were optimised using 
      response surface methodology. The optimized product was then subjected to 
      proximate compositional, physicochemical, biofunctional and microbial analysis. 
      The lactic fermented cactus pear fruit beverage was prepared by mixing 12% [w/v] 
      freeze dried cactus pear fruit powder and 3% sucrose in water, then pasteurised 
      and inoculated with 3% Lactobacillus fermentum MTCC 25515 and Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus M9, then incubated at 37  degrees C for 6 h. The moisture content of the 
      beverage was 87.77% and major constituent was carbohydrate (9.58% per wet matter 
      basis). The 100 mL beverage contains 89.84 mg GAE phenolic compounds, 5.86 mg QE 
      flavonoids, 71.82 mg betacyanin, 28.08 mg betaxanthin, 10.59 mg ascorbic acid. 
      The beverage also exhibited 58% ABTS antioxidant activity. The beverage was shelf 
      stable for 20 days at 7 +/- 1  degrees C. Such a biofunctional beverage loaded with 
      antioxidant potential can be consumed as refreshing drink.

TI  - Full-fat corn germ improves the performance and milk fat yield of Girolando cows 
      fed sugarcane bagasse and cactus cladodes as forage sources.
PG  - 104

AB  - We investigated the effects of replacing ground corn with full-fat corn germ 
      (FFCG) on milk production, milk composition, and nutrient use in cows fed 
      sugarcane bagasse and cactus cladodes. Ten multiparous Girolando cows (average 
      body weight 500 +/- 66 kg, 90 +/- 15 days in milk) were distributed in a replicated 
      5 x 5 Latin Square and assigned to five dietary treatments containing 0%, 25%, 
      50%, 75%, or 100% of full-fat corn germ in substitution to ground corn. Full-fat 
      corn germ increased fat-corrected milk yield by 2.2 kg/day and the synthesis of 
      fat, lactose, and total solids in milk by 94.4, 60.0, and 201.10 g/day, 
      respectively (p < 0.05). Cows fed corn germ quadratically increased (p < 0.05) 
      dry matter intake by 1.01 kg/day, with the intake of crude protein and total 
      digestible nutrients following the same pattern. Conversely, the substitution of 
      corn for full-fat corn germ linearly reduced (p < 0.05) the total non-fiber 
      carbohydrate intake from 5.79 to 4.40 kg/d. Except for ether extract and 
      non-fiber carbohydrates, full-fat corn germ did not alter (p > 0.05) nutrient 
      digestibility. Cows fed corn germ excreted less (p < 0.05) urea-N in milk and 
      urine N. These results demonstrate that full-fat corn germ can partially replace 
      ground corn to enhance the milk production efficiency of crossbred cows fed 
      cactus cladodes and sugarcane bagasse. Furthermore, including sugarcane bagasse 
      in FFCG-supplemented diets prevents milk fat depression in cows fed cactus 
      cladodes.

TI  - A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial: Efficacy of Opuntia 
      ficus-indica Prebiotic Supplementation in Subjects with Gut Dysbiosis.
LID - 10.3390/nu16050586 [doi]

AB  - Gut dysbiosis refers to an imbalance in gut microbiota composition and function. 
      Opuntia ficus-indica extract has been shown to modulate gut microbiota by 
      improving SCFA production in vivo and gastrointestinal discomfort (GD) in humans. 
      The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of Odilia(TM) on 
      gastrointestinal health by changing the microbial diversity of species involved 
      in inflammation, immunity, oxidation, and the brain-gut-muscle axis. A 
      randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 80 adults with gut 
      dysbiosis. The intervention consisted of a 300 mg daily intake of Odilia(TM) (n = 
      40) or maltodextrin as a placebo (n = 40), administered for 8 weeks. Intervention 
      effect was evaluated using 16S metagenomics and GIQLI/GSAS scores at baseline, at 
      4 and 8 weeks. Eight weeks of Odilia(TM) supplementation positively modulates gut 
      microbiota composition with a significant reduction in the Firmicutes to 
      Bacteroidetes ratio (p = 0.0012). Relative abundances of beneficial bacteria 
      (Bacteroides and Clostridium_XIVa) were significantly increased (p < 0.001), in 
      contrast to a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory bacteria (p < 0.001). 
      Accordingly, GIQLI and GSAS scores revealed successful improvement in GD. 
      Odilia(TM) may represent an effective and well-tolerated treatment in subjects 
      with gut dysbiosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural feed additives in broiler feed contribute to the overall 
      health, productivity, and economic viability of broiler chickens while meeting 
      consumer demands and preferences for natural products. The purpose of this 
      research was to determine the effect of green iron nanoparticles (Nano-Fe) and 
      Halimeda opuntia supplementation in broiler diets on performance, ammonia 
      excretion in excreta, Fe retention in tissues and serum, carcass criteria, and 
      meat quality under hot environmental conditions. METHODS: A total of 256 
      one-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to one of four 
      feeding treatments for 42 days. Each treatment had eight replications, with eight 
      chicks per replicate. The treatments were Negative control (CON), positive 
      control (POS) supplemented with 1 g/kg Halimeda opuntia as a carrier, 
      POS + 20 mg/kg Nano-Fe (NFH1), POS + 40 mg/kg Nano-Fe (NFH2). RESULTS: When 
      compared to CON and POS, dietary Nano-Fe up to 40 mg/kg enhanced (p < 0.001) 
      growth performance in terms of body weight (BW), body weight gain (BWG), and feed 
      conversion ratio (FCR). Nano-Fe had the highest BWG and the most efficient FCR 
      (linear, p < 0.01, and quadratic, p < 0.01) compared to POS. Without affecting 
      internal organs, the addition of Nano-Fe and POS enhanced dressing and reduced 
      (p < 0.001) abdominal fat compared to control (CON). Notably, the water-holding 
      capacity of breast and leg meat was higher (p < 0.001), and cooking loss was 
      lower in broilers given Nano-Fe and POS diets against CON. In comparison to POS, 
      the ammonia content in excreta dropped linearly as green Nano-Fe levels 
      increased. When compared to CON, increasing levels of Nano-Fe levels boosted Fe 
      content in the breast, leg, liver, and serum. The birds fed on POS showed better 
      performance than the birds fed on CON. CONCLUSION: Green Nano-Fe up to 40 mg/kg 
      fed to broiler diets using 1 g/kg Halimeda opuntia as a carrier or in single can 
      be utilized as an efficient feed supplement for increasing broiler performance, 
      Fe retentions, carcass characteristics, meat quality, and reducing ammonia 
      excretions, under hot conditions.

AB  - Four yeast isolates collected from flowers from different ecosystems in Brazil, 
      one from fruit of Nothofagus alpina in Argentina, three from flowers of Neltuma 
      chilensis in Chile and one obtained from the proventriculus of a female bumblebee 
      in Canada were demonstred, by analysis of the sequences of the internal 
      transcribed spacer (ITS) region and D1/D2 domains of the large subunit rRNA gene, 
      to represent two novel species of the genus Starmerella. These species are 
      described here as Starmerella gilliamiae f.a, sp. nov. (CBS 16166(T); Mycobank MB 
      851206) and Starmerella monicapupoae f.a., sp. nov. (PYCC 8997(T); Mycobank MB 
      851207). The results of a phylogenomic analysis using 1037 single-copy 
      orthogroups indicated that S. gilliamiae is a member of a subclade that contains 
      Starmerella opuntiae, Starmerella aceti and Starmerella apicola. The results also 
      indicated that S. monicapupoae is phylogenetically related to Starmerella 
      riodocensis. The two isolates of S. monicapupoae were obtained from flowers in 
      Brazil and were probably vectored by insects that visit these substrates. 
      Starmerella gilliamiae has a wide geographical distribution having been isolated 
      in flowers from Brazil and Chile, fruit from Argentina and a bumblebee from 
      Canada.

TI  - Anti-Obesity Effect of Different Opuntia stricta var. dillenii's Prickly Pear 
      Tissues and Industrial By-Product Extracts in 3T3-L1 Mature Adipocytes.
LID - 10.3390/nu16040499 [doi]

AB  - Opuntia stricta var. dillenii fruit is a source of phytochemicals, such as 
      betalains and phenolic compounds, which may play essential roles in health 
      promotion. The aim of this research was to study the triglyceride-lowering effect 
      of green extracts, obtained from Opuntia stricta var. dillenii fruit (whole 
      fruit, pulp, peel, and industrial by-products (bagasse)) in 3T3-L1 mature 
      adipocytes. The cells were treated on day 12, for 24 h, after the induction of 
      differentiation with the extracts, at doses of 10, 25, 50, or 100 mug/mL. The 
      expression of genes (PCR-RT) and proteins (Western blot) involved in fatty acid 
      synthesis, fatty acid uptake, triglyceride assembly, and triglyceride 
      mobilisation was determined. The fruit pulp extraction yielded the highest levels 
      of betalains, whereas the peel displayed the greatest concentration of phenolic 
      compounds. The extracts from whole fruit, peel and pulp were effective in 
      reducing triglyceride accumulation at doses of 50 mug/mL or higher. Bagasse did 
      not show this effect. The main mechanisms of action underpinning this outcome 
      encompass a reduction in fatty acids synthesis (de novo lipogenesis), thus 
      limiting their availability for triglyceride formation, alongside an increase in 
      triglyceride mobilisation. However, their reliance is contingent upon the 
      specific Opuntia extract.

TI  - The Effect of Opuntia ficus Mucilage Pectin and Citrus aurantium Extract Added to 
      a Food Matrix on the Gut Microbiota of Lean Humans and Humans with Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/foods13040587 [doi]
LID - 587
AB  - Experimental studies have provided evidence that physicochemical interactions in 
      the food matrix can modify the biologically beneficial effects of bioactive 
      compounds, including their effect on gut microbiota. This work aimed to evaluate 
      the effect of a food gel matrix with Opuntia ficus cladodes mucilage pectin and 
      Citrus Aurantium extract on the growth of four beneficial gut bacteria obtained 
      from the fecal microbiota of people who are lean or who have obesity after 
      digestion in the upper digestive system. To accomplish this, a base formulation 
      of Opuntia ficus cladodes mucilage with or without C. aurantium extract was 
      submitted to an ex vivo fecal fermentation in an automatic and robotic intestinal 
      system. The changes in the intestinal microbiota were determined by means of 
      plate culture and 16S sequencing, while short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced 
      in the colon were determined via gas chromatography. In the presence of the 
      extract in formulation, greater growth of Bifidobacterium spp. (+1.6 Log(10) 
      Colonic Forming Unit, UFC) and Lactobacillus spp. (+2 Log(10) UFC) in the 
      microbiota of lean people was observed. Only the growth in Salmonella spp. (-1 
      Log(10) UFC) from both microbiota was affected in the presence of the extract, 
      which decreased in the ascending colon. SCFA was mainly produced by the 
      microbiota of people who were lean rather than those who had obesity in the 
      presence of the extract, particularly in the ascending colon. The effect of sour 
      orange extract seems to depend on the origin of the microbiota, whether in people 
      who have obesity (25 mM/L) or are lean (39 mM/L).

AB  - Opuntia silvestri mucilage obtained from dried stems was explored as an 
      emulsifier to prepare double emulsions aiming to encapsulate Lactiplantibacillus 
      plantarum CIDCA 83114. W(1)/O/W(2) emulsions were prepared using a two-step 
      emulsification method. The aqueous phase (W(1)) consisted of L. plantarum CIDCA 
      83114, and the oil phase (O) of sunflower oil. The second emulsion was prepared 
      by mixing the internal W(1)/O emulsion with the W(2) phase, consisting of 4 % 
      polysaccharides, formulated with different mucilage:(citric)pectin ratios. Their 
      stability was assessed after preparation (day 0) and during storage at 4  degrees C 
      (28 days). Determinations included creaming index, color, particle size, 
      viscosity, turbidity, and bacterial viability, along with exposure to simulated 
      gastrointestinal conditions. Significant differences were evaluated by analysis 
      of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's test (P < 0.05). After 28 days storage, 
      bacterial viability in the W(1)/O/W(2) emulsions was above 6 log CFU/mL for all 
      the pectin:mucilage ratios. Emulsions containing mucilage and pectins showed 
      lower creaming indices after 15 days, remaining stable until the end of the 
      storage period. Formulations including 1:1 pectin:mucilage ratio exhibited the 
      highest bacterial viability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and were 
      more homogeneous in terms of droplet size distributions at day 0, hinting at a 
      synergistic effect between mucilage components (e.g., proteins, Ca(2+)) and 
      pectin in stabilizing the emulsions. These results showed that Opuntia silvestri 
      mucilage enhanced the stability of emulsions during refrigerated storage, 
      highlighting its potential for encapsulating lactic acid bacteria. This presents 
      an economical and natural alternative to traditional encapsulating materials.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the association of 
      Opuntia stricta (OS) or Nopalea cochenillifera (NC) with Moringa hay (MY) or 
      Leucaena hay (LY) on nutrient intake, ingestive behavior, serum biochemistry, and 
      milk production and composition of dairy goat. Eight multiparous Saanen goats 
      were used, with an average of 68 +/- 8 days in milk and 48.5 +/- 6 kg of initial 
      weight, fed with the following treatment diets: OS + MY; OS + LY; NC + MY, and 
      NC + LY. The treatments were distributed in a double Latin square, in a 2 x 2 
      factorial scheme (two varieties of cactus and two of hay). Goats fed with NC had 
      higher (P < 0.05) intakes of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber 
      (NDF), and non-fibrous carbohydrates. There was no influence (P > 0.05) on milk 
      production, but goats fed with OS produced milk with higher (P < 0.05) fat 
      content and presented higher (P < 0.05) feed efficiency. There was no effect 
      (P > 0.05) of the hay type on the nutrient intake and milk production and 
      composition of goats, but the animals fed with MY had higher (P < 0.05) serum 
      cholesterol levels and greater efficiency of NDF rumination. Goats fed with OS 
      showed greater feeding and rumination efficiency. Our results indicated that both 
      cactus species could be successfully included in the diet of low yielding dairy 
      goats fed 18.4% concentrate.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Morphological Characteristics between Endangered Local 
      Prickly Pear and the Newly Introduced Dactylopius opuntiae-Resistant Species in 
      Eastern Morocco.

AB  - Prickly pear serves as a significant source of income for farmers worldwide, with 
      production taking place in temperate, subtropical, and cold regions. The 
      objective of the present investigation is to explore the morphological parameters 
      of Opuntia robusta and Opuntia dillenii which are resistant to the white 
      cochineal (Dactylopius opuntiae), as well as the local prickly pear that is 
      currently threatened with extinction. This investigation aims to evaluate the 
      feasibility of replacing the endangered local prickly pear with the recently 
      introduced species O. robusta and O. dillenii. This analysis is based on a 
      comprehensive assessment of 26 qualitative and 25 quantitative traits pertaining 
      to cladodes and fruits. In terms of species differentiation and the selection of 
      discriminative features, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of various 
      statistical methods, as well as the analysis carried out according to the 
      descriptors recommended by the International Union for the Protection of New 
      Varieties of Plants (UPOV). Of the 51 parameters evaluated, 13 qualitative and 23 
      quantitative characters are significant in differentiating the species under 
      study. This underscores the importance of quantitative traits in distinguishing 
      different prickly pear species. Furthermore, color is identified as a crucial 
      characteristic for discriminating between the studied samples. O. robusta is 
      characterized by its high fruit weight, large size, greater pulp content, and 
      high pulp-to-peel ratio, all of which are desirable traits for fresh consumption. 
      Additionally, O. robusta has the highest number of fully developed seeds, making 
      it an attractive option for use in the cosmetic industry. This characteristic 
      renders the O. robusta a potential substitute for the endangered ecotype . 
      However, O. robusta is distinguished by its short stalk, which poses a challenge 
      for fruit harvesting and leaves it susceptible to physical damage and quality 
      loss. Conversely, O. dillenii displays a low pulp content, which serves as a 
      critical indicator of fruit quality. The only desirable agronomic trait of this 
      species is its elevated seed content, which has the potential for utilization in 
      oil production for the cosmetic industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the physical and environmental conditions that may limit 
      the migration of invasive species is crucial to assess the potential for 
      expansion outside their native ranges. The cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum, is 
      native to South America (Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil) and has been 
      introduced and invaded the Caribbean and southern United States, among other 
      regions. In North America there is an ongoing process of range expansion 
      threatening cacti biodiversity of the genus Opuntia and the commercial profits of 
      domesticated Opuntia ficus-indica. METHODS: To further understand what influences 
      the distribution and genetic structure of this otherwise important threat to 
      native and managed ecosystems, in the present study we combined ecological niche 
      modeling and population genetic analyses to identify potential environmental 
      barriers in the native region of Argentina. Samples were collected on the host 
      with the wider distribution range, O. ficus-indica. RESULTS: Significant genetic 
      structure was detected using 10 nuclear microsatellites and 24 sampling sites. At 
      least six genetic groups delimited by mountain ranges, salt flats and wetlands 
      were mainly located to the west of the Dry Chaco ecoregion. Niche modeling 
      supports that this region has high environmental suitability where the upper soil 
      temperature and humidity, soil carbon content and precipitation were the main 
      environmental factors that explain the presence of the moth. Environmental 
      filters such as the upper soil layer may be critical for pupal survival and 
      consequently for the establishment of populations in new habitats, whereas the 
      presence of available hosts is a necessary conditions for insect survival, upper 
      soil and climatic characteristics will determine the opportunities for a 
      successful establishment.

TI  - Opuntia monacantha: Validation of the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic 
      activity of its polyphenolic rich extract in silico and in vivo via assessment of 
      pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Opuntia monacantha belongs to the cactus family 
      Cactaceae and is also known by cochineal prickly pear, Barbary fig or drooping 
      prickly pear. It was traditionally used to treat pain and inflammation. O. 
      monacantha cladodes showed pharmacological effects such as antioxidant potential 
      owing to the presence of certain polysaccharides, flavonoids, and phenols. AIM OF 
      THE STUDY: This research aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory as well as the 
      anti-arthritic potential of ethanol extract of Opuntia monacantha (E-OM). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo edema in rat paw was triggered by carrageenan and 
      used to evaluate anti-inflammatory activity, while induction of arthritis by 
      Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) rat model was done to measure anti-arthritic 
      potential. In silico studies of the previously High performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) characterized metabolites of ethanol extract was performed 
      by using Discovery Studio 4.5 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) within active 
      pocket of glutaminase 1 (GLS1) (PDB code: 3VP1; 2.30 A). RESULTS: EOM, 
      particularly at 750 mg/kg, caused a reduction in the paw edema significantly and 
      decreased arthritic score by 80.58% compared to the diseased group. It revealed 
      significant results when histopathology of ankle joint was examined at 28th day 
      as it reduced inflammation by 18.06%, bone erosion by 15.50%, and pannus 
      formation by 24.65% with respect to the diseased group. It restored the altered 
      blood parameters by 7.56%, 18.47%, and 3.37% for hemoglobin (Hb), white blood 
      count (WBC), and platelets, respectively. It also reduced rheumatoid factor RF by 
      13.70% with concomitant amelioration in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase 
      (SOD) levels by 19%, and 34.16%, respectively, in comparison to the diseased 
      group. It notably decreased mRNA expression levels of COX-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1, 
      NF-kappabeta and augmented the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in real time PCR with respect to 
      the diseased group and piroxicam. HPLC analysis previously performed showed that 
      phenolic acids and flavonoids are present in E-OM. Molecular docking studies 
      displayed pronounced inhibitory potential of these compounds towards glutaminase 
      1 (GLS1), approaching and even exceeding piroxicam. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, Opuntia 
      monacantha could be a promising agent to manage inflammation and arthritis and 
      could be incorporated into pharmaceuticals.

AB  - Elucidating the driving mechanism of microbial community succession during pepper 
      fermentation contributes to establishing efficient fermentation regulation 
      strategies. This study utilized three-generation high-throughput sequencing 
      technology, microbial co-occurrence network analysis, and random forest analysis 
      to reveal microbial community succession processes and driving mechanisms during 
      pepper fermentation. The results showed that more positive correlations than 
      negative correlations were observed among microorganisms, with positive 
      correlation proportions of 60 %, 51.03 %, and 71.43 % between bacteria and 
      bacteria, fungi and fungi, and bacteria and fungi in sipingtou peppers, and 
      69.23 %, 54.93 %, and 79.44 % in zhudachang peppers, respectively. Microbial 
      interactions, mainly among Weissella hellenica, Lactobacillus plantarum, 
      Hanseniaspora opuntiae, and Kazachstania humillis, could drive bacterial and 
      fungal community succession. Notably, the bacterial community successions during 
      the fermentation of two peppers were similar, showing the transition from 
      Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Weissella ghanensis to 
      Weissella hellenica and Lactobacillus plantarum. However, the fungal community 
      successions in the two fermented peppers differed significantly, and the 
      differential biomarkers were Dipodascus geotrichum and Kazachstania humillis. 
      Differences in autochthonous microbial composition and inherent constituents 
      brought by pepper varieties resulted in different endogenous environmental 
      changes, mainly in fructose, malic acid, and citric acid. Furthermore, endogenous 
      environmental factors could also drive microbial community succession, with 
      succinic acid, lactic acid, and malic acid being the main potential drivers of 
      bacterial community succession, whereas fructose, glucose, and succinic acid were 
      the main drivers of fungal community succession. These results will provide 
      insights into controlling fermentation processes by raw material combinations, 
      optimization of environmental parameters, and microbial interactions.

AB  - In this study, three acidic polysaccharides (OFPP-1, OFPP-2 and OFPP-3) were 
      isolated from the pulps of Opuntia dillenii Haw. fruits, and their chain 
      conformations, physicochemical and rheological properties were investigated. The 
      molecular weight and conformational parameters (M(w), M(n), M(z), R(g) and R(h)) 
      of OFPPs in 0.1 M NaNO(3) solution were detected by HPSEC-MALLS-RI. In addition, 
      based on the parameters rho and v, it was concluded that these three polysaccharide 
      chains exhibited sphere-like conformation in 0.1 M NaNO(3) solution, which was 
      consistent with AFM and TEM observations. Furthermore, the Congo Red experiment 
      showed that OFPP-2 had a triple-helix structure, which may be conducive to its 
      biological activity. This study also found that OFPPs were semi-crystalline 
      structures with high thermal and pH stability. The rheological analyses indicated 
      that the apparent viscosity of OFPPs solutions exhibited concentration-, 
      temperature-, and pH-dependence, and the viscoelasticity of them was affected by 
      molecular characteristics and concentration. The results of this study are 
      helpful to elucidate the structure-activity relationship of OFPPs. Moreover, this 
      study can provide theoretical reference for the application of OFPPs as bioactive

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pectobacterium cacticida was identified as the causative agent of 
      soft rot disease in cacti. Due to a high potential of spread in the face of 
      global warming, the species poses a significant threat to horticultural and crop 
      industry. The aim of this study was to revise the genomic, physiology and 
      virulence characteristics of P. cacticida and update its phylogenetic position 
      within the Pectobacterium genus. METHODS: Whole genome sequences of five P. 
      cacticida strains were obtained and subjected to comprehensive genomic and 
      phylogenomic data analyses. We assessed the presence of virulence determinants 
      and genes associated with host and environmental adaptation. Lipidomic analysis, 
      as well as biochemical and phenotypic assays were performed to correlate genomic 
      findings. RESULTS: Phylogenomic analysis revealed that P. cacticida forms a 
      distinct lineage within the Pectobacterium genus. Genomic evaluation uncovered 
      516 unique proteins, most of which were involved in cellular metabolism. They 
      included genes of carbohydrate metabolism and transport and ABC transporters. The 
      main differing characteristics from other Pectobacterium species were the lack of 
      a myo-inositol degradation pathway and the presence of the malonate decarboxylase 
      gene. All tested strains were pathogenic towards Opuntia spp., chicory, Chinese 
      cabbage, and potato, but exhibited only mild pathogenicity towards carrot. 
      DISCUSSION: This study sheds light into the genomic characteristics of P. 
      cacticida and highlights the pathogenic potential of the species. Unique genes 
      found in P. cacticida genomes possibly enhance the species' survival and 
      virulence. Based on phylogenomic analyses, we propose the reclassification of P. 
      cacticida to a new genus, Alcorniella comb. nov.

AB  - A comprehensive evaluation of the habitat suitability across the India was 
      conducted for the introduced species Opuntia ficus-indica. This assessment 
      utilized a newly developed model called BioClimInd, takes into account five Earth 
      System Models (ESMs). These ESMs consider two different emission scenarios known 
      as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), specifically RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. 
      Additionally, the assessment considered two future time frames: 2040-2079 (60) 
      and 2060-2099 (80). Current study provided the threshold limit of different 
      climatic variables in annual, quarter and monthly time slots like temperature 
      annual range (26-30  degrees C), mean temperature of the driest quarter (25-28  degrees C); mean 
      temperature of the coldest month (22-25  degrees C); minimum temperature of coldest month 
      (13-17  degrees C); precipitation of the wettest month (250-500 mm); potential 
      evapotranspiration Thronthwaite (1740-1800 mm). Predictive climatic habitat 
      suitability posits that the introduction of this exotic species is deemed 
      unsuitable in the Northern as well as the entirety of the cooler eastern areas of 
      the country. The states of Rajasthan and Gujarat exhibit the highest degree of 
      habitat suitability for this particular species. Niche hypervolumes and climatic 
      variables affecting fundamental and realized niches were also assessed. This 
      study proposes using multi-climatic exploration to evaluate habitats for 
      introduced species to reduce modeling uncertainties.

AB  - The biostimulant Hanseniaspora opuntiae regulates Arabidopsis thaliana root 
      development and resistance to Botrytis cinerea. Beneficial microbes can increase 
      plant nutrient accessibility and uptake, promote abiotic stress tolerance, and 
      enhance disease resistance, while pathogenic microorganisms cause plant disease, 
      affecting cellular homeostasis and leading to cell death in the most critical 
      cases. Commonly, plants use specialized pattern recognition receptors to perceive 
      beneficial or pathogen microorganisms. Although bacteria have been the most 
      studied plant-associated beneficial microbes, the analysis of yeasts is receiving 
      less attention. This study assessed the role of Hanseniaspora opuntiae, a 
      fermentative yeast isolated from cacao musts, during Arabidopsis thaliana growth, 
      development, and defense response to fungal pathogens. We evaluated the A. 
      thaliana-H. opuntiae interaction using direct and indirect in vitro systems. 
      Arabidopsis growth was significantly increased seven days post-inoculation with 
      H. opuntiae during indirect interaction. Moreover, we observed that H. opuntiae 
      cells had a strong auxin-like effect in A. thaliana root development during in 
      vitro interaction. We show that 3-methyl-1-butanol and ethanol are the main 
      volatile compounds produced by H. opuntiae. Subsequently, it was determined that 
      A. thaliana plants inoculated with H. opuntiae have a long-lasting and systemic 
      effect against Botrytis cinerea infection, but independently of auxin, ethylene, 
      salicylic acid, or jasmonic acid pathways. Our results demonstrate that H. 
      opuntiae is an important biostimulant that acts by regulating plant development 
      and pathogen resistance through different hormone-related responses.

      were made by heating in test tube containing lactic acid and nitric acid 
      protocol. In anatomical findings, irregular, zigzag, wavy, and polygonal 
      epidermal cells with sinuate, sinuous, and straight anticlinal walls were 
      observed. Quantitatively minimum length (28.05 +/- 2.05 mum) and width 
      (23.15 +/- 3.41 mum) of epidermal cells were noted in Cylindropuntia kleiniae. 
      Paracytic type of stomata present was observed in all species with kidney-shaped 
      guard cell present in six species, and in Opuntia macrocentra and 
      Austrocylindropuntia subulata, dumbbell-shaped guard cells were observed. The 
      largest length of stomata (53.25 +/- 2.05 mum) and width of stomata 
      (35.10 +/- 5.19 mum) were observed in Opuntia monacantha. In present research work, 
      stem anatomical features show many diverse characters are of special attention 
      for plant taxonomist for the correct identification and provide baseline for 
      further study in subfamily Opuntiodeae. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: The intricate 
      microstructures of Opuntioideae cactus stems. Investigating the antimicrobial 
      potential of compounds found within Opuntioideae cactus stems. Correlations 
      between the unique structural features observed through SEM and the antimicrobial 
      activity of Opuntioideae cactus stem extracts.

AB  - Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), the cactus moth, is native 
      to South America with a widespread distribution in Argentina. The larvae consume 
      the interior of Opuntia spp. (Cactaceae) plants. The moth was used as a 
      biocontrol agent against invasive non-native Opuntia spp. in many countries 
      around the world. The cactus moth arrived unintentionally in Florida, USA, 
      expanded its range and threatened Opuntia-based agriculture and natural 
      ecosystems in southern North America. The insect is also a pest of cultivated O. 
      ficus-indica L. in Argentina. An endemic South American parasitoid, Goniozus 
      legneri Gordth (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), is used in inundative biological 
      control programmes against lepidopteran pests. The goal of this work was to 
      evaluate G. legneri as a biocontrol agent to be used in inundative releases 
      against C. cactorum. Mortality of C. cactorum by G. legneri was assessed at 
      different spatial scales, as well as the interactions with Apanteles opuntiarum 
      Martinez & Berta (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a common Argentine natural enemy of 
      C. cactorum. The ability of G. legneri to paralyse, parasitise and kill C. 
      cactorum was confirmed. The paralysis inflicted on C. cactorum larvae reduced 
      larval damage to the plants by 85%. Using two parasitoid species increased the 
      mortality of C. cactorum larvae, but it was highly dependent on the order of 
      their arrival. The combined mortality caused by both parasitoids was higher than 
      a single one, in particular when G. legneri arrived first (56 +/- 1%), suggesting 
      asymmetric competition due to the preference of G. legneri attacking previously 
      parasitised larvae. Goniozus legneri has potential as an inundative biocontrol 
      agent of C. cactorum, but its interaction with the classical biocontrol agent A. 
      opuntiarum needs to be considered.

TI  - Fermentation Profile, Aerobic Stability, and Chemical and Mineral Composition of 
      Cactus Pear Silages with Different Inclusion Levels of Gliricidia Hay.
LID - 10.3390/plants13020195 [doi]
LID - 195
AB  - Cactus pear is used in large proportions in diets for small ruminants in semiarid 
      regions. However, its exclusive use is not recommended due to the low fiber and 
      crude protein content and the high water and mineral content, leading to 
      metabolic disorders, low dry matter intake, and weight loss. The use of mixed 
      cactus silage associated with protein and fibrous sources seeks to overcome the 
      deficits in dry matter, fiber and crude protein, aiming to improve the 
      nutritional quality of the diets that will be offered to ruminants. Thus, the use 
      of gliricidia hay in cactus pear silages could represent an important alternative 
      to improve the nutritional and fermentative characteristics of the ensiled 
      material. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the fermentation dynamics, 
      nutritional characteristics, and aerobic stability of mixed silages of cactus 
      pear combined with different levels of gliricidia hay. This was a completely 
      randomized experimental design with five treatments and five repetitions. The 
      treatments consisted of different levels of inclusion of gliricidia hay (0, 10, 
      20, 30, and 40% on a dry matter basis) in the composition of mixed cactus pear 
      silages. The inclusion of gliricidia hay in the composition of mixed silages of 
      cactus pear resulted in a quadratic effect for dry matter recovery, pH, NH(3)-N, 
      buffering capacity, aerobic stability, ether extract, P, K, Na, and Zn (p < 
      0.05). There was a reduction in density, effluent losses, maximum pH, mineral 
      matter, non-fiber carbohydrates, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn (p < 0.05), and an increase 
      in the time to reach maximum pH as well as an upward trend in pH, dry matter, 
      organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and 
      B (p < 0.05). Under experimental conditions, the inclusion of gliricidia hay 
      between 20 and 30% in cactus pear-based silage provided an improvement to the 
      chemical composition and fermentation parameters of the silages.

AB  - Yeast species are a group of coexistent microorganisms in the oral cavity that 
      can cause opportunistic infections in vulnerable individuals, including addicts. 
      This study aimed to identify the yeast species profile responsible for oral yeast 
      colonization (OYC) and the associated risk factors in patients with substance use 
      disorder (SUD) in Ahvaz, Iran. Oral samples were collected from drug users 
      hospitalized in 12 addiction treatment centers, and the related clinical 
      information was mined. Oral yeast species were identified using 21-plex PCR and 
      sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). A total of 
      244 yeast strains were identified from 245 individuals with substance abuse. 
      Candida albicans was the most common species (37.7%) and non-albicans Candida was 
      responsible for 57.7% of OYC, primarily C. dubliniensis (33.2%) and C. glabrata 
      (11.9%). Moreover, uncommon oral yeasts constituted 5.3% of species, including 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Clavispora lusitaniae, Pichia kluyveri, Geotrichum 
      candidum, Magnusiomyces capitatus, Hanseniospora opuntiae, Wickerhamomyces 
      subpelliculosus, Trichosporon asahii, and Aureobasidium pullulans. Importantly, 
      OYC exhibited associations with such factors as duration of drug use, daily drug 
      consumption rate, opioid utilization, oral drug administration, and the 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) 
      score. The present study is the pioneering investigation revealing the prevalence 
      and diversity of oral yeast species, along with associated risk factors, in 
      individuals with SUD in southwestern Iran. Furthermore, it underscores the 
      importance of developing efficient and cost-effective diagnostic methods tailored 
      for resource-constrained settings.

AB  - In this investigation, the study focused on the chemical constitution and the 
      antioxidative as well as anti-inflammatory characteristics of oils and pulpy 
      variants (Imatchan (IM), Harmocha (HA), and Aknari (AK)) sourced from O. 
      dillenii. This inquiry encompassed both in vitro and in silico analyses. 
      High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to ascertain the 
      phenolic constituents, while gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 
      methodologies. were applied to discern the volatile makeup. The appraisal of 
      antioxidant potential was conducted via the deployment of assays such as 
      2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 
      and ferric ion chelating (FIC) techniques. The anti-inflammatory activity was 
      examined using BSA and LOX. Molecular docking methods assessed the antioxidant 
      and anti-inflammatory properties. According to HPLC findings, the most abundant 
      compounds detected in AKO and IMO cultivars were quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside 
      followed by vanillic acid, ferulic acid and tyrolsol. Concerning headspace GC-MS 
      analysis E-11-hexadecenal and (E)-2-undecenal contribute to the major compounds 
      detected in Opuntia HA, IM, and AK pulp and oil. The DPPH IC(50) for AK, HA and 
      IM were 38.41+/-1.54, 42.24+/-0.29 and 15.17+/-1.28 mg/mL, respectively. The FRAP 
      IC(50) capacity of AK, HA and IM was determined to be 30.23+/-0.6, 55.96+/-0.08 and 
      23.41+/-1.83 mg/mL, respectively. AK, HA and IM displayed significant FIC activity, 
      with IC(50) values of 42.75+/-0.63, 39.54+/-0.59 and 35.31+/-1.38 mg/mL, respectively. 
      The AK, HA and IM O. dillenii oils were effective in their anti-inflammatory 
      activity. Molecular docking of O. dillenii oils phenolic compounds was conducted 
      to determine the possible targeted proteins by the phenolic compounds in O. 
      dillenii's compounds. Overall, these fruits demonstrated the potential for new 
      ingredients for culinary or pharmaceutical applications, providing value to these 
      natural species that can flourish in arid conditions.

TI  - Valorization of Prickly Pear Peel Residues (Opuntia ficus-indica) Using 
      Solid-State Fermentation.
LID - 10.3390/foods12234213 [doi]
LID - 4213
AB  - Prickly pear peel (Opuntia ficus-indica) residues can be used as a substrate in 
      solid-state fermentation to obtain bioactive compounds. The kinetic growth of 
      some Aspergillus strains was evaluated. A Box-Hunter and Hunter design to 
      evaluate the independent factors was used. These factors were temperature ( degrees C), 
      inoculum (spores/g), humidity (%), pH, NaNO(3) (g/L), MgSO(4) (g/L), KCl (g/L), 
      and KH(2)PO(4) (g/L). The response factors were the amount of hydrolyzable and 
      condensed tannins. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of fermentation 
      extracts was evaluated. Aspergillus niger strains GH1 and HT3 were the best for 
      accumulating tannins. The humidity, inoculum, and temperature affect the release 
      of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Treatment 13 (low values for temperature, 
      inoculum, NaNO(3), MgSO(4); and high values for humidity, pH, KCl, KH(2)PO(4)) 
      resulted in 32.9 mg/g of condensed tannins being obtained; while treatment 16 
      (high values for all the factors evaluated) resulted in 3.5 mg/g of hydrolyzable 
      tannins being obtained. In addition, the fermented extracts showed higher 
      antioxidant activity compared to the unfermented extracts. Treatments 13 and 16 
      showed low inhibition of E. coli, Alternaria sp., and Botrytis spp. The 
      solid-state fermentation process involving prickly pear peel residues favors the 
      accumulation of condensed and hydrolyzable tannins, with antioxidant and 
      antifungal activity.

TI  - Plant-derived natural medicines for the management of osteoporosis: A 
      comprehensive review of clinical trials.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcme.2023.08.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a chronic and systemic skeletal disease that is 
      defined by low bone mineral density (BMD) along with an increase in bone 
      fragility and susceptibility to fracture. This study aimed to overview clinical 
      evidence on the use of herbal medicine for management of osteoporosis. METHODS: 
      Electronic databases including Pubmed, Medline, Cochrane library, and Scopus were 
      searched until November 2022 for any clinical studies on the efficacy and/or 
      safety of plant-derived medicines in the management of osteoporosis. RESULTS: The 
      search yielded 57 results: 19 on single herbs, 16 on multi-component herbal 
      preparations, and 22 on plant-derived secondary metabolites. Risk of fracture, 
      bone alkaline phosphatase, BMD, and specific bone biomarkers are investigated 
      outcomes in these studies. Medicinal plants including Acanthopanax senticosus, 
      Actaea racemosa, Allium cepa, Asparagus racemosus, Camellia sinensis, Cissus 
      quadrangularis, Cornus mas, Nigella sativa, Olea europaea, Opuntia ficus-indica, 
      Pinus pinaster, Trifolium pretense and phytochemicals including isoflavones, 
      ginsenoside, Epimedium prenyl flavonoids, tocotrienols are among plant-derived 
      medicines clinically investigated on osteoporosis. It seems that multi-component 
      herbal preparations were more effective than single-component ones; because of 
      the synergistic effects of their constituents. The investigated herbal medicines 
      demonstrated their promising results in osteoporosis via targeting different 
      pathways in bone metabolism, including balancing osteoblasts and osteoclasts, 
      anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and estrogen-like functions. 
      CONCLUSION: It seems that plant-derived medicines have beneficial effects on bone 
      and may manage osteoporosis by affecting different targets and pathways involved 
      in osteoporosis; However, Future studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness 
      and safety of these preparations.

TI  - In Vitro Screening and Lipid-Lowering Effect of Prickly Pear (Opuntia 
      Ficus-Indica L. Mill.) Fruit Extracts in 3T3-L1 Pre-Adipocytes and Mature 
      Adipocytes.
PG  - 143-150

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica fruits have been widely used due to their nutritional 
      composition and beneficial effects on health, particularly against chronic 
      diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, among 
      others. In recent years, prickly pear peel and pulp extracts have been 
      characterised, and a high number of bioactive compounds have been identified. 
      This study aimed to analyse the triglyceride-lowering effect of prickly pear peel 
      and pulp extracts obtained from fruits of three varieties (Pelota, Sanguinos, and 
      Colorada) in 3T3-L1 maturing and mature adipocytes. At a concentration of 
      50 microg/mL, peel extracts from Colorada reduced triglyceride accumulation in 
      pre-adipocytes and mature adipocytes. Additionally, at 25 microg/mL, Pelota peel 
      extract decreased triglyceride content in mature adipocytes. Moreover, maturing 
      pre-adipocytes treated with 50 and 25 microg/mL of Sanguinos pulp extract showed a 
      reduction of triglyceride accumulation. In addition, the lipid-lowering effect of 
      the main individual betalain and phenolic compounds standards were assayed. 
      Piscidic acid and isorhamnetin glycoside (IG2), found in Colorada peel extract, 
      were identified as the bioactive compounds that could contribute more notably to 
      the triglyceride-lowering effect of the extract. Thus, the betalain and 
      phenolic-rich extracts from Opuntia ficus indica fruits may serve as an effective 
      tool in obesity management.

TI  - Silvicultural Practices for Diversity Conservation and Invasive Species 
      Suppression in Forest Ecosystems of the Bundala National Park, Sri Lanka.
LID - 10.3390/plants13010121 [doi]
LID - 121
AB  - Forest ecosystems in Sri Lanka are under pressure from intensive human activity 
      and climate change. Invasive species are one of the greatest threats to 
      autochthonous species and ecosystems. In Bundala National Park of Sri Lanka, 
      there are efforts to control and limit the spreading of unwanted invasive 
      Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. and Opuntia dillenii (Ker-Gawl.) Haw., which poses a 
      significant risk to natural ecosystem conservation. Nine different treatment 
      variants (four replications) were used to test which management approach provides 
      the control of Prosopis juliflora. This research is based on nine repeated 
      measurements from 2017 to 2021 on 36 permanent research plots (each 625 m(2)) 
      with 27 observed plant species and a total of 90,651 recorded plant individuals. 
      The results confirmed that the dynamics of species richness, heterogeneity, and 
      evenness showed significant differences between treatments during the five years 
      of dynamics. The lowest species diversity was found in the control variant, 
      followed by treatments based on the hard pruning and thinning of Prosopis 
      juliflora trees. In contrast, strategies emphasizing the complete uprooting of 
      Prosopis juliflora trees, replanting, and support of the natural regeneration of 
      native species showed high species diversity and a high overall number of plant 
      species. Generally, treatments had a significant effect on species diversity and 
      the number of individuals of Prosopis juliflora, while changes in the overall 
      number of plant species were more affected by time and succession. Silvicultural 
      treatments including pruning, uprooting, and thinning have proven to be essential 
      tools for nature conservation across various sites, aimed at enhancing habitat 
      diversity in the face of ongoing climate change.

TI  - Development of Eco-Friendly Biocomposite Films Based on Opuntia ficus-indica 
      Cladodes Powder Blended with Gum Arabic and Xanthan Envisaging Food Packaging 
      Applications.
LID - 10.3390/foods13010078 [doi]
LID - 78
AB  - Currently, food packaging is facing a critical transition period and a major 
      challenge: it must preserve the food products' quality and, at the same time, it 
      must meet the current requirements of the circular economy and the fundamental 
      principles of packaging materials eco-design. Our research presents the 
      development of eco-friendly packaging films based on Opuntia ficus-indica 
      cladodes (OFIC) as renewable resources. OFIC powder (OFICP)-agar, OFICP-agar-gum 
      arabic (GA), and OFICP-agar-xanthan (XG) blend films were eco-friendlily prepared 
      by a solution casting method. The films' properties were investigated by scanning 
      electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray 
      diffraction (X-RD), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Water solubility 
      and moisture content were also determined. Morphology, thickness, molecular 
      interactions, miscibility, crystallinity, and thermal properties, were affected 
      by adjusting the gums (GA and XG) content and glycerol in the blend films. 
      Moisture content increased with increasing glycerol and XG content, and when 1.5 
      g of GA was added. Water solubility decreased when glycerol was added at 50% and 
      increased with increasing GA and XG content. FTIR and XRD confirmed strong 
      intermolecular interactions between the different blend film compounds, which 
      were reflected in the shifting, appearance, and disappearance of FTIR bands and 
      XRD peaks, indicating excellent miscibility. DSC results revealed a glass 
      transition temperature (T(g)) below room temperature for all prepared blend 
      films, indicating that they are flexible and soft at room temperature. The 
      results corroborated that the addition of glycerol at 30% and the GA to the OFICP 
      increased the stability of the film, making it ideal for different food packaging 
      applications.

AB  - Protein-rich seaweeds are regarded as having commercial significance due to their 
      numerous industrial applications. The green seaweed Halimeda opuntia was used 
      during this study for the preparation of bioplastic film. A thin bioplastic film 
      with better physical and mechanical properties was produced by optimizing the 
      ratio of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to seaweed biomass. The films obtained were 
      characterized by their thickness, tensile strength, elongation at break, Young's 
      modulus, moisture absorption resistance, and solubility. To evaluate the 
      composition and potential for chemical reactions of the films, an FTIR 
      spectroscopy examination was conducted. Whereas TG-DTA and AFM were performed on 
      films with high mechanical properties. The bioplastic film produced when algae 
      percent was tripled in PVA concentration had better physical and mechanical 
      characteristics, and the bioplastic films degraded in the environment within a 
      short time. According to the current study, seaweed might serve as an alternative 
      source for the production of bioplastic, which could help minimize the use of 
      non-biodegradable plastics.

TI  - First Report of rattail cactus necrosis-associated virus Infecting Prickly pear 
      (Opuntia macrocentra) in the United States.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-07-23-1344-PDN [doi]
AB  - Black-spined prickly pear (Opuntia macrocentra Engelmann; Cactaceae) is a cactus 
      native to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and northwest Mexico. The plant is often 
      grown for ornamental purposes in the United States. In February 2023, virus-like 
      symptoms such as concentric ringspots and chlorotic spots were observed on O. 
      macrocentra plants grown at the vicinity of Maricopa County Cooperative 
      extension, University of Arizona, Phoenix, AZ (33 degrees 24'24.6"N, 111 degrees 59'15.3"W). 
      Total RNA was extracted from two samples (YPHC-60-A and YPHC-60-B), following the 
      protocol by Tzanetakis et al. (2007). Reverse transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) was performed with degenerate tobamovirus, TobamodF/TobamodR 
      (Li et al. 2018) and potexvirus, 1RC, Potex 2RC, and Potex 5 (van der Vlugt and 
      Berendsen 2002) primers. An expected amplicon of ~880 bp was obtained from both 
      samples using TobamodF/TobamodR primers, while no amplification was observed with 
      potexvirus primers. Further, RT-PCR was carried out using species-specific 
      primers to detect cacti related tobamoviruses: cactus mild mottle virus (CMMoV), 
      rattail cactus necrosis-associated virus (RCNaV) (Park et al. 2018) and Opuntia 
      virus 2 (Salgado-Ortiz et al. 2020). Amplicons of ~540 bp were amplified from 
      both samples using RCNaV specific primers, whereas no amplification was obtained 
      using CMMoV and Opuntia virus 2 specific primers. Then, the amplicons from both 
      YPHC-60 (A-B) isolates (~540 bp) were Sanger sequenced and shared 99.22% 
      nucleotide identity to each other. A BLAST search revealed 93% nucleotide 
      identity with RCNaV CP sequences (KY581586.1, JF729471, and MT130378.1). The 
      sequences were submitted in the GenBank (accessions no. OQ914798 and OR828526). 
      Furthermore, complete RCNaV- RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene was 
      amplified using primers 3490-s-5'GTAGGTGGTACCGCATAGCA-3'; 3490as 
      5'AAACGCAAGTCMRYGACYGA-3' (designed in this study from accession no. JF729471.1, 
      position 3490-3509 and 4905-4925). The expected amplicons of ~1,500 bp were 
      obtained from both YPHC-60 (A-B) samples and sequenced (GenBank: OQ914799 and 
      OR823954) showing 87.5 % identity with RCNaV sequences (JF729471.1 and 
      NC_016442.1). The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree clustered YPHC-60 (A-B) 
      isolates in a single clade with other RCNaV isolates. RCNaV virus particles were 
      isolated from YPHC-60 (A-B) and submitted for RNA extraction, testing positive 
      for RCNaV by RT-PCR. Sap extract of YPHC-60 (A-B) prepared in 0.01 M phosphate 
      buffer (pH =7.0) was used to mechanically inoculate 3 indicator plant species 
      (n=10): Phaseolus vulgaris, Medicago sativa, and Cucumis melo. Also, infected 
      tissue was used to graft Opuntia sp. plants. Symptoms such as local lesions were 
      observed on M. sativa and vein thickening on P. vulgaris 14 days 
      post-inoculation, while Opuntia sp. showed chlorosis 30 days after grafting. 
      RCNaV infection in mechanically inoculated P. vulgaris, M. sativa, and Opuntia 
      sp. was also confirmed through RT-PCR. C. melo and non-inoculated control plants 
      did not show any symptoms, nor tested positive through RT-PCR. RCNaV has been 
      reported earlier to infect cactus species in South Korea (Park et al. 2018) and 
      O. albicarpa in Mexico (De La Torre-Almaraz et al. 2016), where it was found in 
      several orchards. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of RCNaV 
      infecting O. macrocentra in the United States. This study highlights that RCNaV 
      is easily transmitted mechanically or by grafting, which could impact the nursery 
      industry as most cacti are clonally propagated.

TI  - Modulatory effects of dietary prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) peel on high 
      salinity tolerance, growth rate, immunity and antioxidant capacity of Nile 
      tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).
LID - 10.1007/s10695-023-01289-z [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) peel 
      (PPP) on salinity tolerance, growth, feed utilization, digestive enzymes, 
      antioxidant capacity, and immunity of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). PPP 
      was incorporated into four iso-nitrogenous (280 g kg(-1) protein) and 
      iso-energetic (18.62 MJ kg(-1)) diets at 0 (PPP0), 1 (PPP1), 2 (PPP2), and 4 
      (PPP4) g kg(-1). Fish (9.69 +/- 0.2 g) (mean +/- SD) were fed the diets for 75 days. 
      Following the feeding experiment, fish were exposed to a salinity challenge (25 per thousand) 
      for 24 h. Fish survival was not affected by the dietary PPP inclusion either 
      before or after the salinity challenge. Fish fed the PPP-supplemented diets 
      showed lower aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, cortisol, and 
      glucose levels compared to PPP0, with the lowest values being observed in PPP1. 
      Fish fed dietary PPP had higher growth rates and feed utilization than PPP0. 
      Quadratic regression analysis revealed that the best weight gain was obtained at 
      2.13 g PPP kg(-1) diet. The highest activities of protease and lipase 
      enzymes were recorded in PPP1, while the best value of amylase was recorded in 
      PPP2, and all PPP values were higher than PPP0. Similarly, PPP1 showed higher 
      activities of lysozyme, alternative complement, phagocytic cells, respiratory 
      burst, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, and lower 
      activity of malondialdehyde than in PPP0. Further increases in PPP levels above 2 
      g kg(-1) diet led to significant retardation in the immune and antioxidant 
      parameters. Thus, the inclusion of PPP at about 1 to or 2 g kg(-1) diet can 
      improve stress tolerance, immunity, and antioxidant capacity in Nile tilapia.

TI  - Generation of PVP Membranes Using Extracts/Phenolic Fraction of Dysphania 
      ambrosioides, Opuntia ficus-indica, and Tradescantia pallida.
LID - 10.3390/polym15244720 [doi]
LID - 4720
AB  - In the present work, electrospun membranes of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) 
      nanofibers were manufactured using extracts and phenolic fractions of Dysphania 
      ambrosioides (epazote), Opuntia ficus-indica (nopal), and Tradescantia pallida 
      (chicken grass). The characterization of the membranes was carried out by 
      scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The 
      membranes synthesized through the use of the extracts generally showed a slight 
      decrease in the diameter of the fibers but an increase in the size of the pores 
      due to the presence of nanoparticles (rosaries) on the surface of the fibers, 
      while the membranes synthesized using the phenolic fraction demonstrated an 
      inversely proportional relationship between the compounds of this family with the 
      diameter of the fibers and the size of the pore, allowing to elucidate part of 
      the polymerization mechanisms of PVP nanofibers, in addition to proposing a 
      reaction mechanism in the interaction between PVP and phenolic compounds for 
      surface functionalization. Likewise, we demonstrate that the generation of 
      reaction seeds through functionalization allows the addition of other compounds 
      to the fibers in the membranes synthesized using the complete extract.

      Characterisation.
LID - 10.3390/polym15244640 [doi]

AB  - Pectin and alginate are well-established biopolymers used in natural film 
      development. Single-polymer mucilage films were developed from freeze-dried 
      native mucilage powder of two cultivars, 'Algerian' and 'Morado', and the films' 
      mechanical properties were compared to single-polymer pectin and alginate films 
      developed from commercially available pectin and alginate powders. The casting 
      method prepared films forming solutions at 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% (w/w) for each 
      polymer. Considerable variations were observed in the films' strength and 
      elasticity between the various films at different polymer concentrations. 
      Although mucilage films could be produced at 5% (w/w), both cultivars could not 
      produce films with a tensile strength (TS) greater than 1 MPa. Mucilage films, 
      however, displayed > 20% elongation at break (%E) values, being noticeably more 
      elastic than the pectin and alginate films. The mechanical properties of the 
      various films were further modified by varying the pH of the film-forming 
      solution. The various films showed increased TS and puncture force (PF) values, 
      although these increases were more noticeable for pectin and alginate than 
      mucilage films. Although single-polymer mucilage films exhibit the potential to 
      be used in developing natural packaging, pectin and alginate films possess more 
      suitable mechanical attributes.

TI  - Bioactive-Loaded Hydrogels Based on Bacterial Nanocellulose, Chitosan, and 
      Poloxamer for Rebalancing Vaginal Microbiota.

AB  - Biocompatible drug-delivery systems for soft tissue applications are of high 
      interest for the medical and pharmaceutical fields. The subject of this research 
      is the development of hydrogels loaded with bioactive compounds (inulin, thyme 
      essential oil, hydro-glycero-alcoholic extract of Vitis vinifera, Opuntia 
      ficus-indica powder, lactic acid, citric acid) in order to support the vaginal 
      microbiota homeostasis. The nanofibrillar phyto-hydrogel systems developed using 
      the biocompatible polymers chitosan (CS), never-dried bacterial nanocellulose 
      (NDBNC), and Poloxamer 407 (PX) incorporated the water-soluble bioactive 
      components in the NDBNC hydrophilic fraction and the hydrophobic components in 
      the hydrophobic core of the PX fraction. Two NDBNC-PX hydrogels and one 
      NDBNC-PX-CS hydrogel were structurally and physical-chemically characterized 
      using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), 
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and rheology. The hydrogels were also 
      evaluated in terms of thermo-responsive properties, mucoadhesion, 
      biocompatibility, and prebiotic and antimicrobial effects. The mucin binding 
      efficiency of hydrogel base systems was determined by the periodic acid/Schiff 
      base (PAS) assay. Biocompatibility of hydrogel systems was determined by the MTT 
      test using mouse fibroblasts. The prebiotic activity was determined using the 
      probiotic strains Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 
      subsp. plantarum. Antimicrobial activity was also assessed using relevant 
      microbial strains, respectively, E. coli and C. albicans. TEM evidenced PX 
      micelles of around 20 nm on NDBNC nanofibrils. The FTIR and XRD analyses revealed 
      that the binary hydrogels are dominated by PX signals, and that the ternary 
      hydrogel is dominated by CS, with additional particular fingerprints for the 
      biocompounds and the hydrogel interaction with mucin. Rheology evidenced the gel 
      transition temperatures of 18-22  degrees C for the binary hydrogels with thixotropic 
      behavior and, respectively, no gel transition, with rheopectic behavior for the 
      ternary hydrogel. The adhesion energies of the binary and ternary hydrogels were 
      evaluated to be around 1.2 J/m(2) and 9.1 J/m(2), respectively. The hydrogels 
      exhibited a high degree of biocompatibility, with the potential to support cell 
      proliferation and also to promote the growth of lactobacilli. The hydrogel 
      systems also presented significant antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity.

LID - 10.3390/foods12244403 [doi]
LID - 4403
AB  - The present study was carried out to valorize the Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) 
      by-products by extracting and identifying their biochemical compounds and 
      evaluating their antioxidant potential by in vitro activities (DPPH radical and 
      FRAP), as well as their capacity to stabilize margarine oxidation (rancimat 
      test). In addition, their in vitro anticoccidial effect on the destruction of 
      Eimeria oocysts isolated from naturally infected chickens was also targeted. 
      Microwaves and response surface methodology tools were used to extract the 
      maximum amount of phenolic compounds (42.05 +/- 0.46 GAE mg/g DW of total phenolic 
      compounds in 90 s at 400 watts). Moreover, the effect of extraction factors was 
      also studied. Eight phenolic compounds, including isorhamnetin, 
      dihydrokaempferol, and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, were identified. The findings 
      confirmed that OFI peel extract has strong antioxidant activities (DPPH radical, 
      ferric reducing power). The rancimat test shows that OFI peel extract improves 
      margarine stability by 3.2 h. Moreover, it has a notable destruction rate of 
      Eimeria oocysts (30.06 +/- 0.51%, LC(50): 60.53 +/- 0.38 mg/mL). The present 
      investigation offers promise for the reuse of food waste as natural margarine 
      additives, protection of the environment, and substitution of anticoccidial 
      synthetic treatments.

TI  - Mucilage-assisted fabrication of molybdenum trioxide nanostructures for 
      photothermal ablation of breast cancer cells.
LID - 10.1002/bab.2543 [doi]
AB  - Nanostructures have been used for various biomedical applications due to their 
      optical, antibacterial, magnetic, antioxidant, and biocompatible properties. 
      Cancer is a prevalent disease that severely threatens human life and health. 
      Thus, innovative and effective therapeutic approaches are urgently required for 
      cancer. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising approach to killing cancer 
      cells. In this investigation, we developed a low-cost, simple, green technique to 
      fabricate molybdenum trioxide nanostructures (MNs) using Opuntia ficus-indica 
      mucilage as a template. Moreover, the MNs were functionalized with folic acid 
      (FA) for cancer PTT. The X-ray diffractometer results revealed that the prepared 
      MNs have an orthorhombic crystal phase. The transmission electron microscope 
      image of MNs shows a flake shape with 20-150 nm diameter. The cytotoxicity of MNs 
      and FA-conjugated MNs was studied in vitro. These cell viability assay results 
      suggested that fabricated MoO(3) nanostructures reduced 25% of cell viability in 
      MCF-7 cells, even at high doses. However, even with high-dose treatment, FA/MNs 
      do not cause significant cell death. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) 
      staining revealed DNA and chromatin condensation in MCF-7 cells exposed to MNs. 
      Overall, the in vitro study results suggested that FA/MNs have excellent 
      biocompatibility, which applies to biomedical applications. MNs dispersion 
      temperature gradually increases from 26 to 58 degrees C under 808 nm laser irradiation. 
      We found significant mortality rates after NIR irradiation in MNs- or 
      FA/MNs-treated MCF-7 cells. These findings suggest that FA/MNs can be used as an 
      effective photothermal agent to treat breast cancer.

AB  - The Cholla cactus is a species of cacti that survives in arid environments and 
      produces a unique mesh-like porous wood. In this article, we present a 
      comprehensive investigation on the hierarchical structure and micromechanical 
      properties of the Cholla cactus wood. Multiple approaches consisting of X-ray 
      tomography, scanning electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, 
      nanoindentation, and finite element simulations were used to gain insight into 
      the structure, property, and design principles of the Cholla cactus wood. The 
      microstructure of the Cholla cactus wood consists of different components, 
      including vessels, rays, and fibers. In the present study, we quantitatively 
      describe the structure of each of these wood components and their likely 
      functions, both from the perspective of biological and mechanical behavior. 
      Nanoindentation experiments revealed for the first time that the cell walls of 
      the fibers exhibit stiffness and hardness higher than those of rays. Furthermore, 
      the idea of making porous, thin-walled cylinders was abstracted from the design 
      of vessel elements, and the structures inspired by this principle were studied in 
      tensile and torsional loading conditions using finite element simulations. Finite 
      element simulations revealed that the utilization of a larger volume of material 
      to carry the load leads to an increase in toughness of these structures, and thus 
      suggested that the pores should be architected to maximize the distribution of 
      load. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The Cholla cactus wood possess a unique 
      hierarchical structure that enables it to thrive in arid environments. Our 
      correlative microscopy approach reveals incredible strategies that individual 
      wood components exhibit to enable the survival of Cholla cactus in extreme 
      environments. The present work quantifies the microstructure and mechanical 
      properties of this very interesting natural system. We further investigate a 
      design principle inspired by the vessel elements, one of the wood components of 
      Cholla cactus, using finite element simulations. The study presented here 
      advances our understanding of the structural significance of Cholla cactus and 
      potentially other desert plants and will further help design architected 
      structural materials.

AB  - The Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) cactus, a crucial crop in Morocco, is threatened by 
      the wild cochineal, Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockerell). The aim of this research 
      was to investigate the efficacy of nine bacterial strains against both D. 
      opuntiae nymphs and adults females applied individually or after black soap in 
      the laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions. Using the partial 16S ribosomal 
      DNA, the bacterial isolates were identified as Pseudomonas koreensis, Pseudomonas 
      sp., Burkholderia sp. and Bacillus sp. Under laboratory conditions, the 
      insecticidal activity of P. koreensis strain 66Ms.04 showed the level mortality 
      (88%) of adult females' at 10(8) CFU/mL, 7 days after application. At a 
      concentration of 10(8) CFU/mL, P. koreensis strain 66Ms.04 and Pseudomonas sp. 
      (strains 37 and 5) caused 100% nymphs mortality rate three days after 
      application. Under greenhouse conditions, the use of P. koreensis strain 66Ms.04 
      at 10(8) CFU/mL following the application of black soap (60 g/L) demonstrated the 
      maximum levels of females and nymphs' mortalities with 80 and 91.25%, 
      respectively, after 8 days of treatment. In field conditions, the combined 
      application of the P. koreensis strain 66Ms.04 at 10(8) CFU/mL with black soap at 
      60 g/L, for an interval of 7 days, significantly increased the mortality of adult 
      females to 93.33% at 7 days after the second application. These findings showed 
      that the combined treatment of P. koreensis strain 66Ms.04 with black soap can be 
      a potent and eco-friendly pesticide against D. opuntiae.

AB  - Cactus pear cladodes, clones 'Miuda' (MIU) and 'Orelha de Elefante Mexicana' 
      (OEM) were harvested at 6 am and 8 pm during the rainy-dry, dry and rainy seasons 
      to evaluate the effect of type of clone and harvest seasons on the 
      physicochemical and technological properties of mucilage as well as the optical, 
      physicochemical, mechanical, thermal and microstructural characteristics of the 
      films obtained. The mucilage of the OEM clone presented a higher content of 
      phenolic compounds, compared to the Nopalea genus, regardless of the season and 
      time of harvest. Furthermore, the dry period resulted in higher carbohydrate 
      levels, regardless of the harvest time. The biopolymeric films produced from the 
      OEM clone harvested in the rainy season and rainy-dry transition showed darker 
      color, better mechanical properties, water barrier, compact microstructure and 
      thermal stability when compared to the MIU clone. Furthermore, harvesting at 6 am 
      provided improvements in the mechanical conditions, permeability and thermal 
      stability of the films of both types of clones studied. These results showed 
      strong environmental modulation, naturally incorporating important macromolecules 
      such as carbohydrates and phenolic compounds, used in the industry in the 
      production of nutraceutical foods, into the mucilage. Furthermore, harvesting 
      cladodes at 6 am in the rainy and transitional (rainy-dry) periods provided 
      better quality biopolymeric films and/or coatings.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes are by-products which contain high amounts of 
      fibres, bioactive and functional compounds. Given their high annual productivity 
      per hectare, cladodes represent a cheap and suitable substrate, usable for 
      fermentation processes. We investigated their potential as a substrate for the 
      growth and production of lactic acid from Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5. A 
      separate hydrolysis and fermentation was performed. The concentration of reducing 
      sugars obtained after the dilute acid and enzymatic hydrolysis was 28.45 g/L. The 
      lactobacillus count ranged from 6.03 to 8.1 log CFU/mL, whereas lactic acid yield 
      and productivity were 0.63 g/g and 0.73 g/L h, respectively. The maximum lactic 
      acid concentration was found to be 17.5 g/L. This study reports the possibility 
      of using the O. ficus indica cladode for lactic acid production by LA-5 aiming to 
      reduce costs for sustainable industrial production.

AB  - An in-depth analysis of the mechanistic processes underlying the evolution and 
      ecophysiology of typical invasive plants such as Carpobrotus spp., Acacia spp., 
      Agave spp., and Opuntia spp. in Mediterranean-type ecosystems shows very 
      sophisticated, complex, and efficient strategies for invasion success, 
      particularly in fragmented habitats. Propagule pressure at both geographical and 
      temporal scales and the establishment of long-term seed banks are determinant for 
      invasion success. A two-sword strategy based on long-term prevention and 
      eradication is proposed for the management of Mediterranean-type ecosystems. 
      Eradication of invasive plants in Mediterranean-type ecosystems appears to be 
      extremely difficult nowadays and, at least for some invaders like Carpobrotus 
      spp., long-term approaches that ultimately culminate in the elimination of seed 
      banks is the only path for success.

AB  - The process of wound healing involves complex interplay of systems biology, 
      dependent on coordination of various cell types, both intra and extracellular 
      mechanisms, proteins, and signaling pathways. To enhance these interactions, 
      drugs must be administered precisely and continuously, effectively regulating the 
      intricate mechanisms involved in the body's response to injury. Controlled drug 
      delivery systems (DDS) play a pivotal role in achieving this objective. A 
      proficient DDS shields the wound from mechanical, oxidative, and enzymatic 
      stress, against bacterial contamination ensuring an adequate oxygen supply while 
      optimizing the localized and sustained delivery of drugs to target tissue. A 
      pH-sensitive SPH was designed by blending two natural polysaccharides, Opuntia 
      mucilage and carrageenan, using microwave irradiation and optimized according to 
      swelling index at pH 1.2, 7.0, and 8.0 and % porosity. Optimized grade was 
      analyzed for surface hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity using OCA. Analytical 
      characterizations were performed using FTIR, TGA, XRD, DSC, reflecting 
      semicrystalline behavior. Mechanical property confirmed adequate strength. In 
      vitro drug release study with ciprofloxacin-HCL as model drug showed 97.8 % 
      release within 10 h, fitting to the Korsmeyer-Peppas model following diffusion 
      and erosion mechanism. In vitro antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory assays,

TI  - First report of Pectobacterium brasiliense causing banana soft rot in Ecuador.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-08-23-1575-PDN [doi]
AB  - Banana (Musa spp.) is the most economically important crop in Ecuador, with 
      exports representing 35% of the agricultural GDP of the country. It covers 
      230,000 hectares, mostly concentrated in three coastal provinces, Guayas, Los 
      Rios, and El Oro. Between July and September 2022, disease symptomatic banana cv. 
      Williams plants were observed in commercial plantations located in two parishes 
      in the province of Guayas (Naranjito and Lorenzo de Garaicoa) and one parish in 
      the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas (La Concordia), with an incidence 
      that ranged from 5% to 15%. Symptoms included soft rot of the pseudostem and 
      rhizome decay, characterized by a fetid odor. Three symptomatic pseudostems from 
      each location were collected, washed with running water to remove any debris, and 
      dried with absorbent paper. From the lesion of each pseudostem, seven pieces of 2 
      cm(2) were taken, surface-sterilized, and macerated in 9 ml of sterile peptone 
      water (0.1% w/v). The macerate was diluted three fold in sterile water, plated on 
      nutrient agar, and incubated at 30 degrees C for 24 h. Eight randomly picked colonies, 
      with convex elevation and creamy white color, were isolated on nutrient agar. 
      Each of the bacterial isolates was biochemically profiled by the Biolog system 
      (Biolog Inc., USA) and identified as Pectobacterium. Three isolates, one from 
      each parish (FP220416, FP220694, and FP220904), were selected for testing Koch's 
      postulates and further identification. Sequences from fragments of the 16S, dnaA, 
      gapA and gyrB genes were obtained from these isolates, following the protocols 
      used by Dobhal et al. (2020) and Boluk et al. (2020), showing 98.1-99.0%, 98.2%, 
      99.7-99.8%, and 98.4-98.9% identitity, respectively, with sequences from the P. 
      brasiliense type strain LMG_21371 (Acc. number JQOE00000000). The obtained 
      sequences were deposited in GenBank with the following accession numbers: 
      OR392417, OR371545,OR371546, OR727281, OR727282, and OR739074-OR739080. Using 
      BEAST v.1.10.4 (Suchard et al.,2018), a bayesian multilocus phylogenetic tree was 
      built with multiple sequence alignments of dnaA, gapA, ang gyrB from 22 P. 
      brasiliense isolates and 2 P. aquaticum isolates used as outgroup. The 
      phylogenetic analysis showed that the Ecuadorian isolates cluster with P. 
      brasiliense BF20, isolated from Opuntia ficus-indica in Mexico and are closely 
      related with the type strain. Pathogenicity tests were conducted through syringe 
      infiltration with 1 ml of 1 x 10;8 CFU ml-1 bacterial suspensions. Each of the 
      three characterized isolates were inoculated into the pseudostems of five healthy 
      4-month-old banana plants of the Williams cultivar. Negative control plants were 
      infiltrated with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated at 25 degrees C and 
      74% relative humidity. Black lesions started to appear 11 days after inoculation 
      and 5 weeks after inoculation plants showed clear symptoms of soft rot of the 
      pseudostem, including fetid odor associated with plant tissue decomposition. 
      Control plants remained symptom-free. Bacteria were re-isolated only from 
      symptomatic pseudostems and identified as P. brasiliense with specific primers 
      Pb1F and Pb1R. Soft rot of banana caused by different enterobacteria including 
      Dickeya zeae, Erwinia carotovora, and Erwinia chrysanthemi hasve been previously 
      reported (Jingxin et al. 2022, Arun et al. 2012, Loganathan, et al. 2019). This 
      is the first report of P. brasiliense causing soft rot of banana in Ecuador, the 
      biggest exporter of the fruit in the world.

AB  - Red dragon fruit (RDF) is well-known for its high nutritional content, especially 
      the red pigment betacyanins that possess high antioxidant activity. Natural 
      fermentation is an ancient yet outstanding technique that relies on the 
      autochthonous microbiota from fruits and vegetables surfaces to preserve and 
      improve the nutritional values and quality of the food product. The present study 
      was to evaluate and identify the indigenous microbial community (bacteria and 
      fungi) that are involved in the natural fermentation of RDF. Results revealed a 
      total of twenty bacterial pure cultures and nine fungal pure cultures were 
      successfully isolated from fermented red dragon fruit drink (FRDFD). For the 
      first time, the PCR amplification of 16S rRNA and ITS regions and sequence 
      analysis suggested nine genera of bacteria and three genera of fungi 
      (Aureobasidium pullulans, Clavispora opuntiae, and Talaromyces aurantiacus) 
      present in the FRDFD. Four dominant (>/=10 % isolates) bacteria species identified 
      from FRDFD were Klebsiella pneumonia, Brevibacillus parabrevis, Bacillus 
      tequilensis and Bacillus subtilis. The carbohydrate fermentation test showed that 
      all the indigenous microbes identified were able to serve as useful starter 
      culture by fermenting sucrose and glucose, thereby producing acid to lower the pH 
      of FRDFD to around pH 4 for better betacyanins stability. The present study 
      provides a more comprehensive understanding of the indigenous microbial community 
      that serves as the starter culture in the fermentation of RDF. Besides, this 
      study provides a useful guide for future research to be conducted on studying the 
      rare bacterial strains (such as B. tequilensis) identified from the FRDFD for 
      their potential bioactivities and applications in medical treatment and 
      functional foods industries.

AB  - The invasion of ecosystems by non-native species is recognized as one of the most 
      significant global challenges, particularly in semiarid regions where native 
      biodiversity is already under stress from drought and land degradation. The 
      implicit assumption is that invaders are strong competitors, but a greenhouse 
      pairwise experiment conducted to examine intraspecific and interspecific 
      competition effects of Opuntia ficus-indica, a widespread invader in semiarid 
      ecosystems, with two species native to the highlands of Eritrea, Ricinus communis 
      and Solanum marginatum, revealed that O. ficus-indica is a weak competitor. The 
      unique ability of O. ficus-indica's fallen cladodes to undergo vegetative growth 
      becomes a fundamental trait contributing to its spread. This growth strategy 
      allows O. ficus-indica to outgrow native species and establish a significant 
      presence. In direct interaction, the competition in aboveground productivity 
      measured by the logarithmic response ratio for O. ficus-indica was 3.4-fold and 
      5.9-fold higher than for R. communis and S. marginatum, respectively. 
      Belowground, the native R. communis was facilitated (- 1.00 +/- 0.69) by O. 
      ficus-indica which itself suffered from high competition. This pattern became 
      even more evident under water shortage, where aboveground competition for S. 
      marginatum decreased 5.7-fold, and for O. ficus-indica, it increased 1.4-fold. 
      Despite being a poor competitor, O. ficus-indica outperformed R. communis and S. 
      marginatum in both aboveground (4.3 and 3.8 times more) and belowground (27 and 
      2.8 times more) biomass production, respectively. The findings of this study 
      challenge the common interpretation that invasive species are strong competitors 
      and highlight the importance of considering other factors, such as productivity 
      and tolerance limits when assessing the potential impacts of invasive species on 
      semiarid ecosystems.

TI  - Unraveling the Role of Prickly Pear Extract as a Potent Nutraceutical Agent 
      Against Metabolic Syndromes.
PG  - 159-168
LID - 10.7417/CT.2023.2483 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prickly pear (Opuntia) extracts have garnered con-siderable attention 
      in recent years due to their promising medicinal and nutritional properties. This 
      comprehensive review explores the multifaceted potential of prickly pear extracts 
      in mitigating various chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), 
      diabetes, obesity, cancer, neuronal diseases, and renal diseases. METHODS: This 
      review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse therapeutic applications 
      of Opuntia extracts in managing chronic diseases. The collective evidence 
      underscores the potential of prickly pear as a valuable natural resource for 
      addressing global health challenges. Further research and clinical investigations 
      are warranted to unlock the full potential of Opuntia in the prevention and 
      treatment of chronic diseases. RESULTS: Studies have suggested that the bioactive 
      compounds within prickly pear may influence glucose metabolism by improving 
      insulin sensitivity, reducing insulin resistance, and modulating gut microbiota 
      composition. These pathways exhibit potential in the reduction of hyperglycemia, 
      which is a fundamental aspect of metabolic syndromes. Opuntia extracts 
      demonstrate also antioxidant, anti-inflammatory capabilities that can contribute 
      to improving health in various conditions. CONCLUSION: Further research and 
      clinical investigations are warranted to unlock the full potential of Opuntia in 
      the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and wound healing effects 
      of the polysaccharide extract from Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes (TPL-Ofi) using 
      a rat cutaneous wound model. After anaesthesia, four 7-mm-diameter dorsal wounds 
      per animal (n = 6/group for each experimental day of evaluation) were created in 
      female Wistar rats using a surgical punch. The animals were treated topically 
      twice daily with TPL-Ofi (0.01-1%; treated group) or sterile saline (control 
      group) for a period of 21 days. Ulcerated tissue was collected for analysis of 
      histological parameters (inflammation score, number of polymorphonuclear, 
      mononuclear, fibroblast/myofibroblasts and blood vessels), immunohistochemical 
      (fibroblast growth factor 2 [FGF-2]) and oxidative stress markers 
      (myeloperoxidase [MPO] and glutathione [GSH]). After 21 days of treatment, body 
      weight, net organ weight and plasma biochemical levels were measured. TPL-Ofi, 
      containing a total carbohydrate content of 65.5% and uronic acid at 2.8%, reduced 
      oedema on the second day and increased the nociceptive threshold on the second 
      and third days. TPL-Ofi reduced mononuclear infiltrate on the second and MPO 
      activity on the fifth day. TPL-Ofi increased GSH levels on the second day, as 
      well as fibroblast/myofibroblasts counts, neoangiogenesis and FGF-2 levels on the 
      fifth and seventh days. No changes were observed in body weight, net organ weight 
      or toxicology assessment. Topical application of TPL-Ofi exhibited 
      anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects, ultimately improving wound healing 
      in cutaneous wounds.

AB  - New sources of antibacterial drugs have become urgent with increasing bacterial 
      resistance. Medicinal plants are attractive sources for antimicrobial compounds 
      with fewer side effects and cheaper obtention. Brazil contains six biomes, 
      including Caatinga, a semi-arid tropical vegetation exclusively from Brazil that 
      contains over thousand vascular plant species. This review presents the potential 
      of using Caatinga plant products to treat multidrug-resistant bacteria. This 
      review used the keywords of antimicrobial resistance, resistance profile, 
      multidrug resistance, Caatinga biome, and pathogenic bacteria to search in 
      Scientific Electronic Library Online, the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and 
      Google Scholar. Plant species as Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl., Annona vepretorum 
      Mart., Croton pulegioides Baill., Myracrondruon urundeuva Allemo, Cereus jamacaru 
      DC., Opuntia ficus-indica L., Bauhinia forficata L., Eucalyptus globulus, Croton 
      sonderianus Muell. Arg., Campomanesia pubescens, and Abarema cochliacarpos showed 
      bacteriostatic activity. Encholirium spectabile Mart., Hymenaea courbaril L., 
      Neoglaziovia variegata Mez, Selaginella convoluta Spring, Encholirium spectabile 
      Mart., Bromelia laciniosa Mart., Hymenaea martiana, Commiphora leptophloeos, and 
      Mimosa tenuiflora presented bactericidal activity. Those extracts inhibited 
      clinical-importance bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. 
      Therefore, Caatinga biome plants are a valuable source of active biomolecules 
      against pathogenic bacteria, and their therapeutic potential must be further 
      explored.

TI  - Microstructural and Mechanical Properties of Calcium-Treated Cactus Pear Mucilage 
      (Opuntia spp.), Pectin and Alginate Single-Biopolymer Films.
LID - 10.3390/polym15214295 [doi]
LID - 4295
AB  - Pectin and alginate satisfy multiple functional requirements in the food 
      industry, especially relating to natural packaging formulation. The continuous 
      need for economic and environmental benefits has promoted sourcing and 
      investigating alternative biomaterials, such as cactus pear mucilage from the 
      cladodes of Opuntia spp., as natural packaging alternatives. The structural and 
      mechanical properties of mucilage, pectin and alginate films developed at a 5% 
      (w/w) concentration were modified by treating the films with calcium (Ca) in the 
      calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) form. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the 5% 
      (w/w) 'Algerian' and 'Morado' films to display considerable microstructure 
      variation compared to the 5% (w/w) pectin and alginate films, with calcium 
      treatment of the films influencing homogeneity and film orientation. Treating the 
      alginate films with a 10% (w/w) stock CaCl(2) solution significantly increased (p 
      < 0.05) the alginate films' tensile strength (TS) and puncture force (PF) values. 
      Consequently, the alginate films reported significantly higher (p < 0.05) film 
      strength (TS and PF) than the pectin + Ca and mucilage + Ca films. The mucilage 
      film's elasticity was negatively influenced by CaCl(2), while the pectin and 
      alginate films' elasticity was positively influenced by calcium treatment. These 
      results suggest that the overall decreased calcium sensitivity and poor 
      mechanical strength displayed by 'the Algerian' and 'Morado' films would not make 
      them viable replacements for the commercial pectin and alginate films unless 
      alternative applications were found.

AB  - Recently, the interest on improving livestock products' nutraceutical profiles by 
      sustainable feeding systems has increased. In this context, the overall quality 
      and, in particular, the nutraceutical profile of dairy products obtained by 16 
      lactating Cinisara cows fed integrated in dry season with Opuntia ficus-indica 
      cladodes, were investigated. Two homogeneous groups of cows (milk yield: 6.3 +/- 
      1.5 kg; body weight: 213 +/- 55 kg) were in succession fed with 2 different diets 
      (CON: pasture and wheat bran; OFI: pasture, wheat bran and cladodes), according 
      to a 2 x 2 Latin square design. The bulk milk was used to make Caciotta cheeses, 
      analyzed at 0, 15 and 30 storage days. Milk and cheeses samples were analyzed for 
      chemical, physical and microbiological traits. On the final products, the 
      nutraceutical and sensorial profiles, together with the antioxidant's capacity 
      were also determined. On milk, only the urea content in individual samples was 
      reduced in OFI. Considering the cheeses, the integration with cladodes did not 
      influence the starter cultures development acted with 2 strains of S. 
      thermophilus, but caused a higher content of polyphenols and a consequent greater 
      antioxidant capacity, together with a change in the fatty acids profile. In 
      particular, the caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, and palmitic fatty acids were 
      higher, as well as the petroselinic, vaccenic, rumenic, and alpha-linolenic fatty 
      acids. Differently, the oleic and the gamma-linolenic fatty acids were lower. The 
      cheeses of OFI showed better overall acceptability, and a higher yellow color, 
      odor intensities, and butter flavor. The multivariate analysis well distinguished 
      the cheeses belonging to the 2 groups. Further investigations should be conducted 
      to formulate well balanced diets including cladodes for Cinisara lactating cows, 
      but also to determine the content of other important bioactive compounds in fresh 
      and in treated cladodes, as well as their effects on animals' welfare and their 
      productions.

AB  - Ag(2)O nanoparticle synthesis was carried out via co-precipitation technique 
      based on using AgNO(3) and secondary metabolites present in the aqueous extract 
      of Opuntia humifusa fruit for the first time. The amount of measured total 
      phenol, flavonoid content, flavone, and flavonol content, and anthocyanin were 
      38.46 mug eq gallic acid mg(-1) extract, 8.34 mug eq quercetin mg(-1) extract, 
      0.614 mug eq quercetin mg(-1) DW, and 3.1 mmol L(-1), respectively. Moreover, the 
      predominant phenolic compound was gallic acid. Catechin and chlorogenic acid were 
      found in both fruit juice and fruit aqueous extract. Scanning electron microscopy 
      (SEM) of Ag(2)O-NPs showed the average particle size was 10.58 nm. Scanning 
      electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction Spectroscopy, and UV/visible spectrometry 
      also confirmed the synthesis. This study then focuses on IC(50) and NO amount 
      differences before and after the synthesis of Ag(2)O-NPs which were 448.29 and 
      101.38 mug mL(-1) for IC(50) and 35.7% and 62.6% for NO, respectively.

TI  - Assessment of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of Opuntia ficus indica 
      L. Cladodes extract.
PG  - 2275417
LID - 10.1080/19932820.2023.2275417 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of 
      the methanolic extract of Opuntia ficus indica L. in small animal (rats and mice 
      model). The current treatment for febrile conditions often involves the use of 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can have adverse effects, 
      particularly gastrointestinal ulcers. Therefore, there is a growing need to 
      explore natural alternatives with fewer side effects. The study utilized various 
      experimental models to assess the effects of the extract. The results 
      demonstrated a significant analgesic effect of the extract, as evidenced by a 
      reduction in pain induced by acetic acid and hot plate tests. Additionally, the 
      extract exhibited anti-inflammatory effects, as indicated by a decrease in 
      carrageenan-induced paw edema and dextran-induced inflammation. To gain insights 
      into the chemical composition of the extract, HPLC analysis was conducted. The 
      analysis successfully identified and quantified 20 compounds, including luteolin, 
      galangin, catechin, thymol, methylated quercetin, quercetin, rutin, acacetin, 
      hesperidin, apigenin, kaempferol, pinocembrin, chrysin, gallic acid, caffeic 
      acid, ascorbic acid, ferulic acid, m-coumaric acid, rosmarinic acid, and 
      trans-cinnamic acid.The findings suggest that Opuntia ficus indica L. extract 
      holds promise as an effective and reasonably priced natural remedy for pain and 
      inflammation in rats and mice model. The comprehensive chemical composition 
      analysis provided valuable insights into the presence of various bioactive 
      compounds, which may contribute to the observed therapeutic effects. Further 
      research and exploration of the extract's mechanisms of action are warranted to 
      fully understand its potential in small animal healthcare.

TI  - Dactylopius opuntiae [Cockerell] Could Be a Source of Antioxidants for the 
      Preservation of Beef Patties.
LID - 10.3390/insects14100811 [doi]
LID - 811
AB  - Dactylopius opuntiae is an insect pest that contains at least carminic acid, 
      which has antioxidant properties. Since there is a relationship between the 
      antioxidant ability and preservative action of compounds applied to meat 
      products, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant activity and 
      usefulness of a D. opuntiae extract for beef patty preservation. The insects were 
      bred and processed to obtain a liquid extract. For the extract, its carminic acid 
      content, antioxidant activity against two free radicals, and actions on food 
      quality parameters were determined. The D. opuntiae dry powder contained 2.91% 
      w/w carminic acid, while the liquid extract exhibited an IC50 value of 3437.8 +/- 
      67.8 and 19633.0 +/- 674.5 microg/mL against the DPPH and ABTS radicals. Nevertheless, 
      these antioxidant actions were lower than those found in a D. coccus extract. The 
      D. opuntiae extract improved in a short time the redness and yellowness, 
      eliminated the unfavorable effect of their vehicle on the MetMb level, and 
      greatly reduced the TBARS formation. For the first time, an extract of D. 
      opuntiae was applied to beef patties, and its beneficial antioxidant action on 
      meat acceptance parameters was confirmed, which has potential commercial 
      applications.

TI  - Purification and Characterization of Polyphenol Oxidase in the Fruits of Opuntia 
      ficus-indica.
LID - 10.3390/biology12101339 [doi]
LID - 1339
AB  - Firstly, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was purified from the fruits of Opuntia 
      ficus-indica using Sepharose 4B-L-tyrosine-p-aminobenzoic acid affinity 
      chromatography, and the enzyme was characterized. The PPO was purified 
      20.59-fold. Thereafter, PPO was performed on sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The kinetic parameters, 
      optimum pHs, and optimum temperatures were investigated for three substrates. 
      Opuntia ficus-indica PPO's optimum pH and optimum temperature were 9.0 and 20  degrees C; 
      7.5 and 20  degrees C; and 7.5 and 30  degrees C, respectively, when using pyrogallol, catechol, 
      and 4-methyl catechol as substrates. For the pyrogallol, catechol, and 4-methyl 
      catechol, the Km, Vmax, and Vmax/Km values were determined as 16.67 mM, 833.33 
      U/mLmin, and 50 U/mLminmM; 6.33 mM, 126.58 U/mLmin, and 20 U/mLminmM; and 5.38 
      mM, 107.53 U/mLmin, and 20 U/mLminmM, respectively. As a result, pyrogallol was a 
      more appropriate substrate than catechol and 4-methyl catechol for the PPO from 
      Opuntia ficus-indica.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the nutritional, mineral, and 
      phytochemical analyses of some selected wild edible plants from Tach Gaint 
      District, Northwest Ethiopia. Proximate composition parameters (moisture, ash, 
      crude fibre, crude fat, crude protein, carbohydrate, and energy) were evaluated 
      using the methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, and 
      elemental analysis was performed using the atomic absorption spectroscopy 
      technique. Results from the nutritional analysis show that Erucastrum abyssinicum 
      leaves had the highest crude protein content (17.47 +/- 0.03 g/100 g), followed by 
      Amaranthus graecizans (14.97 +/- 0.03 g/100 g). The maximum moisture content 
      (40.8 +/- 0.00 g/100 g) and ash content (24.70 +/- 0.15 g/100 g) were reported in the 
      leaves of Amaranthus graecizans. The young shoots of Rumex abyssinicus had the 
      highest crude fat content (14.07 +/- 0.03 g/100 g) and the highest fibre content 
      (34.70 +/- 0.25 g/100 g), while the fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica had the highest 
      amount of utilisable carbohydrate (44.4 +/- 0.00 g/100 g) and the estimated energy 
      value (326.4 +/- 0.00 Kcal/100 g). Calcium was detected in considerable proportions 
      (754.9 +/- 0.23 mg/100 g) followed by iron (31.63 +/- 0.03 mg/100 g) in Urtica 
      simensis leaves and zinc content (3.09 +/- 0.02 mg/100 g) in young shoots of Rumex 
      abyssinicus. Qualitative phytochemical screening, alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, 
      triterpenes, saponins, and tannins were found in the methanolic extract of the 
      plants. The results of this study suggest that the consumption of such 
      nutrient-rich wild edible plants could help add a remarkable amount of nutrient 
      and mineral in the human diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there is a wide use of wild edible plants (WEPs) in 
      Ethiopia, very little work has so far been done, particularly, in the Tigray 
      Region, northern Ethiopia, to properly document the associated knowledge. The 
      purpose of this study was, therefore, to document knowledge and analyze data 
      related to the use of wild edible and nutraceutical plants in Raya-Azebo District 
      of Tigray Region. The district was prioritized for the study to avoid the further 
      loss of local knowledge and discontinuation of the associated practices because 
      of the depletion of wild edible plants in the area mainly due to agricultural 
      expansion and largely by private investors. METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      ethnobotanical study was carried out in the study District to collect data 
      through individual interviews held with purposively selected informants, 
      observation, market surveys, and ranking exercises. Descriptive and inferential 
      statistical methods were employed to analyze and summarize the data using 
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. RESULTS: The study 
      documented 59 WEPs, the majority of which (57.63%) were sought for their fruits. 
      Most of the WEPs (49 species) were consumed in the autumn, locally called qewei, 
      which includes the months of September, October, and November. Ziziphus 
      spina-christi L. Desf., Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Del. and Opuntia ficus-indica 
      (L.) Miller were the most preferred WEPs. Both interviews and local market 
      surveys revealed the marketability of Opuntia ficus-indica, Ziziphus 
      spina-christi, Ficus vasta Forssk., Ficus sur Forssk., and Balanites aegyptiaca. 
      Of the total WEPs, 21 were reported to have medicinal (nutraceutical) values, of 
      which Balanites aegyptiaca and Acacia etbaica scored the highest rank order 
      priority (ROP) values for their uses to treat anthrax and skin infections, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current investigation demonstrated the wide use of 
      WEPs in the district. In future nutritional composition analysis studies, 
      priority should be given to the most popular WEPs, and nutraceutical plants with 
      the highest ROP values.

AB  - In the current situation, wine areas are affected by several problems in a 
      context of global warming: asymmetric maturities, pH increasing, high alcohol 
      degree and flat wines with low freshness and poor aroma profile. The use of 
      emerging biotechnologies allows to control or manage such problems. Emerging 
      non-Saccharomyces as Lachancea thermotolerans are very useful for controlling pH 
      by the formation of stable lactic acid from sugars with a slight concomitant 
      alcohol reduction. Lower pH improves freshness increasing simultaneously 
      microbiological stability. The use of Hanseniaspora spp. (specially H. vineae and 
      H. opuntiae) or Metschnikowia pulcherrima promotes a better aroma complexity and 
      improves wine sensory profile by the expression of a more complex metabolic 
      pattern and the release of extracellular enzymes. Some of them are also 
      compatible or synergic with the acidification by L. thermotolerans, and M. 
      pulcherrima is an interesting biotool for reductive winemaking and bioprotection. 
      The use of bioprotection is a powerful tool in this context, allowing oxidation 
      control by oxygen depletion, the inhibition of some wild microorganisms, 
      improving the implantation of some starters and limiting SO(2). This can be 
      complemented with the use of reductive yeast derivatives with high contents of 
      reducing peptides and relevant compounds such as glutathione that also are 
      interesting to reduce SO(2). Finally, the use of emerging non-thermal 
      technologies as Ultra High-Pressure Homogenization (UHPH) and Pulsed Light (PL) 
      increases wine stability by microbial control and inactivation of oxidative 
      enzymes, improving the implantation of emerging non-Saccharomyces and lowering 
      SO(2) additions. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT.

TI  - Global Research Trends on the Utilization of Nopal (Opuntia Sp) Cladodes as a 
      Functional Ingredient for Industrial Use.
PG  - 621-629
LID - 10.1007/s11130-023-01113-2 [doi]
AB  - Although nopal cladodes are a valuable bioactive compound source, they have 
      historically been underused. This review draws a parallel between quantitative 
      and qualitative data from the most outstanding scientific research concerning 
      nopal cladodes in the last five years by implementing a bibliometric analysis. 
      Italy, Mexico, Brazil, and Morocco accounted for approximately 55% of the 111 
      articles selected for this review. Nopal cladodes are a great source of 
      nourishing ingredients such as mucilage, pectin, insoluble fibers, minerals, 
      ascorbic acid, and bioactive compounds such as carotenoids (e.g., beta-carotene, 
      lutein, and cryptoxanthin), flavonoids (e.g., isorhamnetin, quercetin, rutin, and 
      catechin), phytosterols (e.g., beta-sitosterol and beta-campesterol). Additionally, 
      they offer technological benefits as a food ingredient, allied to good sensory 
      acceptability. The findings suggest that medium-aged cladodes (20 days) have the 
      highest concentration of soluble fiber, protein, and bioactive compounds, 
      rendering them the optimal maturity stage for consumption and processing. 
      Therefore, nopal cladodes can be exploited for several industries, including 
      biotechnology, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, and they have attracted attention 
      as a promising ingredient for the food industry in the concept of the next 
      generation of innovative and functional vegetable foods.

AB  - Cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and conventional cancer 
      therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy often result in undesirable and 
      adverse effects. Natural products have emerged as a promising alternative for 
      cancer treatment, with comparatively fewer side effects reported. Opuntia 
      ficus-indica (L.) Mill., a member of the Cactaceae family, contains a diverse 
      array of phytochemicals, including flavonoids, polyphenols, betalains, and 
      tannins, which have been shown to exhibit potent anticancer properties. Various 
      parts of the Opuntia plant, including the fruits, stems/cladodes, and roots, have 
      demonstrated cytotoxic effects against malignant cell lines in numerous studies. 
      This review comprehensively summarizes the anticancer attributes of the 
      phytochemicals found in Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill., highlighting their 
      potential as natural cancer prevention and treatment agents. Bibliometric metric 
      analysis of PubMed and Scopus-retrieved data using VOSviewer as well as QDA 
      analysis provide further insights and niche to be explored. Most anticancer 
      studies on Opuntia ficus-indica and its purified metabolites are related to 
      colorectal/colon cancer, followed by melanoma and breast cancer. Very little 
      attention has been paid to leukemia, thyroid, endometrial, liver, and prostate 
      cancer, and it could be considered an opportunity for researchers to explore O. 
      ficus-indica and its metabolites against these cancers. The most notable 
      mechanisms expressed and validated in those studies are apoptosis, cell cycle 
      arrest (G0/G1 and G2/M), Bcl-2 modulation, antiproliferative, oxidative 
      stress-mediated mechanisms, and cytochrome c. We have also observed that cladodes 
      and fruits of O. ficus-indica have been more studied than other plant parts, 
      which again opens the opportunity for the researchers to explore. Further, cell 
      line-based studies dominated, and very few studies were related to animal-based 
      experiments. The Zebrafish model is another platform to explore. However, it 
      seems like more in-depth studies are required to ascertain clinical utility of 
      this biosustainable resource O. ficus-indica.

AB  - The iron nanoparticles (Fe-NPs) have been synthesized using an environmentally 
      friendly and simple green synthesis method. This study aims to obtain an aqueous 
      extract from natural material wastes for synthesizing Fe-NPs. The produced Fe-NPs 
      were evaluated as adsorbents for removing Pb, Se, Cu, Zn, and Cr from aqueous 
      solutions. The formation of Fe-NPs was observed on exposure of the aqueous 
      extract to the ferrous chloride and ferric chloride solutions. The 
      characterization of the synthesized Fe-NPs was carried out using different 
      instrumental techniques. As a function of the initial metal ion concentration, 
      contact time, and various doses, the removal of the heavy metal ions was 
      investigated. The UV-Vis spectrum of Fe-NPs showed a peak at 386 nm, 386 nm, 400 
      nm, 420 nm, 210 nm, 215 nm, and 272 nm of banana, pomegranate, opuntia, orange, 
      potato, and onion, respectively. The FT-IR spectra confirmed the attachment of 
      bioactive molecules from plants on the Fe-NPs surface. The effective reduction of 
      metal ions was greatly aided by the -OH functional groups. The functional groups 
      were examined and responsible for adsorption process by nanoparticle powder 
      sample, these peaks are 3400 cm-1, 2900 cm-1, 1600 cm-1,1000 cm-1, and 1550 cm-1. 
      The magnetization measurements revealed superparamagnetic behavior in the 
      produced iron oxide nanoparticles. Heavy metal ions uptake followed a time, dose, 
      and initial concentration-dependent profile, with maximum removal efficiency at 
      45 min, 0.4 g, and 3.0 mg/L of metal concentration, respectively.

AB  - In this study, the potential of cactus pear pruning waste (CPPW) as a low-cost 
      adsorbent biomass for phosphorus (P) removal from aqueous solutions was 
      investigated in batch mode. Biomass samples derived from cactus pear were 
      collected and analyzed to investigate their properties when enriched with either 
      calcium (Ca) or iron (Fe). The examination focused on the capacity of these 
      samples to remove P. The P removal capacities were determined to be 
      2.27 mg g(-1), 1.33 mg g(-1), and 1.87 mg g(-1) for Ca(2+)-enriched, 
      Fe(2+)-loaded, and Fe(3+)-loaded biomass respectively. Among the various models 
      studied, the Langmuir isotherm model was identified as the most appropriate for 
      accurately describing the P adsorption the enriched biomass. The kinetics of the 
      adsorption process were analyzed by applying the pseudo-first-order, 
      pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion models. The pseudo-second-order 
      model provided the best fit to the experimental data. Furthermore, the desorption 
      and regeneration process was investigated, revealing minimal P desorption (less 
      than 8%) from Ca or Fe-loaded biomass, indicating the strong stability of the 
      biomass-cation-P system. The estimated cost ranged from 8 to 161 euros per tonne, 
      with an additional 230 euros when considering the pruning costs inherent to the 
      crop. These costs fall below the threshold (320 euros per tonne) for the 
      economically viable P reuse at the farm level. Consequently, CPPW, when reduced 
      to powder and loaded with ions, emerges as an affordable adsorbent with good 
      removal performance, offering a promising avenue for direct utilization in 
      agriculture as both soil conditioner and fertiliser.

AB  - Aspergillus ochraceus is an ochratoxin-producing fungus which contaminates 
      coffee. In this study the antifungal effect of the yeast Hanseniaspora opuntiae 
      on three Aspergillus ochraceus strains (IOC 4417, IOC 4462, Ao 14) was evaluated 
      in vitro and on coffee fruits. H. opuntiae (10(6) and 10(7) cells mL(-1)) reduced 
      in vitro fungal growth from 82% to 87%, when co-cultivated with A. ochraceus. The 
      yeast cell free supernatant (CFS) inhibited conidial germination from 76.5% to 
      92.5%, and hyphal growth from 54% to 78%. The yeast (10(7) and 10(9) cells 
      mL(-1)) applied on coffee fruits delayed fruit decay by A. ochraceus (IOC 4417 
      and Ao 14) until the 9th day, and was significantly different (p < 0.05) from the 
      controls. Furthermore, the ultrastructure of the yeast-fungus interaction on the 
      coffee fruit surface showed yeast attachment to A. ochraceus hyphae, and 
      morphological alterations in fungal structures, with hyphal abnormalities, such 
      as tortuous hyphae with irregular, non-uniform surface compared to the control 
      without yeast. H. opuntiae showed efficacy as biocontrol agent and, to the best 
      of our knowledge, this is the first study on the antifungal activity of H. 
      opuntiae against A. ochraceus on coffee fruits Nevertheless, application of H. 
      opuntiae to the crop in the field requires further studies.

AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of cactus flour on the 
      anxious-like behavior and cerebral lipid peroxidation in elderly rats (18 months 
      of life). The rats were divided into four groups (n=10). control (CG) - received 
      the AIN-93M ration. P5%. P10% and P15%. treated with the AIN-93M ration with the 
      addition of 5, 10 and 15% of cactus flour respectively. In the elevated plus maze 
      (EPM) groups P5%, P10% and P15% remained longer in the open arms. P15% remained 
      longer in this region and less time in the closed arms. No significant 
      differences were observed between the groups regarding the time the rats remained 
      in the center of the apparatus. P5%. P10% and P15% performed a greater number of 
      head dips. Regarding the open field animals P5%. P10% and P15% performed a 
      greater number of rearing and stayed for a longer time in the center of the 
      apparatus with P15% being the group that remained for the longest time when 
      compared to the other groups. There was no difference in locomotion and grooming. 
      As for the light-dark box. P15% spent more time in the light part. less time in 
      the dark part and performed a smaller number of transitions. P5%. P10% and P15% 
      had the lowest concentrations of brain lipid peroxidation. Our data demonstrated 
      that consumption of cactus flour by rats promoted anxiolytic effects and 
      minimized brain lipid peroxidation in aging. Given the above, it can be deduced 
      that cactus pear can contribute to the prevention and/or treatment of anxiety in 
      the aging phase.Due to its concentrations of mono and polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids, soluble fibers and antioxidant contents such as vitamin E and selenium.

TI  - Increased Plasticity in Invasive Populations of a Globally Invasive Cactus.
LID - 10.3390/plants12183287 [doi]
LID - 3287
AB  - Biological invasions pose global threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functions. 
      Invasive species often display a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, enabling 
      them to adapt to new environments. This study examines plasticity to water stress 
      in native and invasive Opuntia ficus-indica populations, a prevalent invader in 
      arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Through controlled greenhouse experiments, we 
      evaluated three native and nine invasive populations. While all plants survived 
      the dry treatment, natives exhibited lower plasticity to high water availability 
      with only a 36% aboveground biomass increase compared to the invasives with a 
      greater increase of 94%. In terms of belowground biomass, there was no 
      significant response to increased water availability for native populations, but 
      plants from the invasive populations showed a 75% increase from the dry to the 
      wet treatment. Enhanced phenotypic plasticity observed in invasive populations of 
      O. ficus-indica is likely a significant driver of their success and invasiveness 
      across different regions, particularly with a clear environmental preference 
      towards less arid conditions. Climate change is expected to amplify the invasion 
      success due to the expansion of arid areas and desertification. Opuntia 
      ficus-indica adapts to diverse environments, survives dry spells, and grows 
      rapidly in times of high-water supply, making it a candidate for increased 
      invasion potential with climate change.

TI  - Application of a Simplex-Centroid Mixture Design to Evaluate the Phenolic 
      Compound Content and Antioxidant Potential of Plants Grown in Mexico.

AB  - Nowadays, the food and health industries are generating new products with 
      antioxidant potential; among them are those rich in phenolic compounds that have 
      a beneficial impact on human health. Therefore, the aim of this research was to 
      obtain different types of mixtures from Portulaca oleraceae (P), Chenopodium 
      album (C), Opuntia oligacantha Forster var. Ulapa (O), and Amaranthus tricolor 
      (A) and evaluate the content of total phenols, total flavonoids, and antioxidant 
      potential in order to select the mixture with the highest content of phenolic 
      compounds. An experimental simplex-centroid mixture design with 15 experimental 
      treatments was used; the data were analyzed and adjusted to a quadratic model 
      that allowed for the prediction of the content of phenols, flavonoids, and 
      antioxidant activity using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 
      2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) of different 
      experimental mixtures. The results show that the individual components of C and P 
      had the highest content of phenols and antioxidant potential. It was observed 
      that the binary mixtures P-C and P-A presented values of total phenols greater 
      than 11 mg of gallic acid equivalents g(-1) DW and values of flavonoids greater 
      than 13 mg of quercetin equivalents g(-1) DW. These values were higher than those 
      found in the individual components. The P-C mixture with an antioxidant potential 
      of 66.0 +/- 0.07 Trolox equivalents g(-1) DW could be used as an additive in food 
      or to obtain a functional food that improves the intake of antioxidant compounds 
      in the population.

TI  - Evaluation of In Vitro Antioxidant, Anti-Obesity, and Anti-Diabetic Activities of 
      Opuntia ficus Cladodes Gel and Its Application as a Preservative Coating for 
      Shrimp during Refrigerated Storage.
LID - 10.3390/gels9090716 [doi]
LID - 716
AB  - Opuntia ficus cladodes (OFC) are considered one of the wastes that result from 
      opuntia cultivation, and their disposal by traditional methods results in many 
      environmental problems. Therefore, this study was conducted with two aims. The 
      first was the production of OFC gel, and the evaluation of its in vitro 
      antioxidant (by two methods, DPPH and ABTS), anti-obesity, and anti-diabetic 
      activities. The second was an investigation of the effects of different 
      concentrations of this gel (0, 50, and 100%) as an edible coating on the quality 
      of shrimp during 8 days of refrigerated storage. The results showed that this gel 
      was characterised by a high content of ash (10.42%), total carbohydrates 
      (75.17%), and total phenols (19.79 mg GAE/g). OFC gel contained six types of 
      sugars: arabinose, xylose, galactose, rhamnose, glucose, and uronic acid, and the 
      most abundant was xylose (36.72%). It is also clear from the results that the OFC 
      gel had high antioxidant properties, which were higher against DPPH than ABTS at 
      the same concentration. OFC gel showed a high inhibition activity against lipase, 
      alpha-glycosidase, and alpha-amylase enzymes, and their IC(50) values were 1.43 mg/mL, 
      0.78 mg/mL, and 0.57 mg/mL, respectively. The results also stated that shrimp 
      coated with OFC gel had lower pH, drip loss, TVB-N, and TBA values through the 
      days of refrigerated storage. Moreover, the shrimp coated with 100% OFC gel were 
      better than those coated with 50% OFC gel. In conclusion, OFC gel showed high 
      potency as active antioxidant, for its enzyme anti-activities, and as an edible 
      coating for shrimp.

TI  - Green Synthesis for Carbon Quantum Dots via Opuntia ficus-indica and Agave 
      maximiliana: Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Sensing Applications.
PG  - 33342-33348
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.3c02735 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we present an alternative method for synthesizing carbon quantum 
      dots (CQDs) using a green synthesis approach via extracts from Agave maximiliana 
      and Opuntia ficus-indica(Ofi). The extracts from both plants were used as the 
      carbon source for the CQDs. The synthesis method employs mesoporous zeolite 4A as 
      a refractory for the thermal treatment of the samples. Transmission electron 
      microscopy analysis established that the size of the CQDs shows a narrow 
      distribution centered around 2 nm with a maximum size of less than 3 nm for both 
      cases. The CQDs exhibit absorption bands associated with pi-pi* transitions located 
      around 220 nm. In both cases, photoluminescence (PL) phenomenon was detected by 
      irradiating the samples with a UV wavelength and detecting emissions close to the 
      blue wavelength. Additionally, both kinds of CQDs were tested as surface-enhanced 
      Raman scattering (SERS) substrates against methylene blue (MB), indicating an 
      enhancement associated with ring deformation and stretching modes of the v(C-C) 
      and v(C-N) bonds located around 1400 and 1620 cm(-1), respectively. 
      Complementarily, in the framework of density functional theory, H(2n)C(2(2m+1)) 
      structures (with n = 3-5 and m = 1-3) were used as a theoretical representation 
      of CQDs in interaction with the MB molecule. It is used for developing the 
      analysis of charge transfer effects between both systems and for specifying 
      elements that generate the SERS effect associated with the chemical enhancement 
      mechanism.

AB  - The possibility of using Opuntia ficus indica fruit juice (OFIFJ) as a 
      bioflocculant for conditioning the synthetic kaolin sludge and sewage sludge 
      (region Oran, Algeria, and Pau, France) was studied. Turbidity of the 
      supernatant, dryness of the sludge cake, and total time of filtration (TTF) were 
      examined parameters. Using vacuum filtration, lime was also tested as a chemical 
      conditioner and gives good results on Lescar (France) sewage sludge in terms of 
      cake's dryness, filtrate quality, turbidity (13.54%), and total time of 
      filtration (TTF = 85.29%), comparing to the industrial polymer (Sedifloc 408C; 
      turbidity; 8.33% and TTF: 2.94%). For the sewage sludge of Oran (Algeria), the 
      results obtained with OFIFJ were compared to those obtained with the cladodes 
      juice of the same plant OFIC, and also with a cationic polymer (Superfloc 8396). 
      For an optimum dosage, it showed that OFIFJ has a flocculation activity as same 
      as the cladodes juice OFIC for sludge conditioning and gives better results in 
      terms of turbidity (dosage of 22.4 g/kg DM: 3.7 NTU for OFIC, dosage of 8.36: 
      3.63 NTU for OFIFJ. Dryness was enhanced from 14.91 to 22.93% (OFIC 16 g/kg DM) 
      and to 24.48% (OFIF 20.9 g/kg DM) but for TTF, we found the opposite. In fact, 
      this plant showed to be an available, biodegradable, and non-toxic flocculant. 
      For kaolin synthetic sludge (30%), the optimum dosages of those conditioners were 
      found to be 0.066 g kg(-1) for OFIC, comparing between vacuum filtration and 
      filtration compression; turbidity was enhanced for both techniques, contrary to 
      dryness. Concerning the Oran city sewage sludge, both turbidity and dryness were 
      optimized. Same thing for the France sewage sludge, all the studied parameters 
      were enhanced with the two studied bioflocculants.

      8 wt%). The microstructure, thickness, moisture content, density, water contact 
      angle, water vapor permeability, film solubility, thermal stability, and 
      toughness of mucilage films blended with SBL (SBL/CMET and SBL/CMIS) were 
      measured. The properties of mucilage-based films varied systematically, depending 
      on the concentration of mucilage. The addition of SBL to CM film produces 
      compatible, hydrophobic, flexible, and stiffer films with low moisture contents 
      and good barrier properties. The mucilage film incorporated with 6 wt% CMET and 
      CMIS reached the highest Young's modulus of 1512 +/- 21 and 1988 +/- 55 MPa, 
      respectively. The DSC of produced films reveals that the Tg of SBL/CMIS is lower 
      than that of SBL/CMIS. The synthesized films were structurally stable at high 
      temperatures. The biodegradability of the composite films buried in the ground 
      shows that the produced films are 100 % biodegradable after 40 days. Thus, CM 
      blended with SBL can benefit specific applications, especially food packaging.

AB  - Adapting our food production chain and increasing the flora and fauna's 
      livelihood in climate change-affected areas using Opuntia is not only theoretical 
      but already exists in practice in many places. This cactus grows in unsuitable 
      soil for most species as it is adapted to arid and semi-arid soils and hot 
      weather. In these regions, Opuntia protects from erosion and contributes to soil 
      health. The usage of this plant as fodder is also discussed, with immense 
      potential in substituting a part of livestock's diet and even increasing the 
      quality of the animal's by-products and decreasing water consumption. This would 
      result in a feed that is low-cost and has a lower environmental impact. It is to 
      be noted that Opuntia has a high potential as an invasive species, with caution 
      always being recommended when dealing with this specie. The high content of 
      specific compounds, such as proline, indicaxanthin, and betanin, found in Opuntia 
      ficus-indica, influence the plant's adaptation to unfavourable conditions. This 
      collective evidence depicts Opuntia as a crop that can battle climate change and 
      ensure food security.

      Behavior of Biochars for Electrocatalyst Support Applications.
LID - 10.3390/ma16165571 [doi]
LID - 5571
AB  - The present work reports the synthesis and the physicochemical characterization 
      of biochar from the organic wastes of nopal (Opuntia Leucotricha), coffee grounds 
      (Coffea arabica) and Ataulfo mango seeds (Mangifera indica) as alternative 
      electrocatalyst supports to Vulcan XC-72 carbon black. The biochars were prepared 
      using pyrolysis from organic wastes collected at three temperatures, 600, 750 and 
      900  degrees C, under two atmospheres, N(2) and H(2). The synthesized biochars were 
      characterized using Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to 
      obtain insights into their chemical structure and morphological nature, 
      respectively, as a function of temperature and pyrolysis atmosphere. A N(2) 
      adsorption/desorption technique, two-point conductivity measurements and cyclic 
      voltammetry (CV) were conducted to evaluate the specific surface area (SSA), 
      electrical conductivity and double-layer capacitance, respectively, of all the 
      biochars to estimate their physical properties as a possible alternative carbon 
      support. The results indicated that the mango biochar demonstrated the highest 
      properties among all the biochars, such as an electrical conductivity of 8.3 
      S/cm(-1) at 900  degrees C in N(2), a specific surface area of 829 m(2)/g at 600  degrees C in 
      H(2) and a capacitance of ~300 mF/g at 900  degrees C in N(2). The nopal and coffee 
      biochars exhibited excellent specific surface areas, up to 767 m(2)/g at 600  degrees C 
      in N(2) and 699 m(2)/g at 750  degrees C in H(2), respectively; nonetheless, their 
      electrical conductivity and capacitance were limited. Therefore, the mango 
      biochar at 900  degrees C in N(2) was considered a suitable alternative carbon material 
      for electrocatalyst support. Additionally, it was possible to determine that the 
      electrical conductivity and capacitance increased as a function of the pyrolysis 
      temperature, while the specific surface area decreased for some biochars as the 
      pyrolysis temperature increased. Overall, it is possible to conclude that heat 
      treatment at a high temperature of 900  degrees C enhanced the biochar properties toward 
      electrocatalyst support applications.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to identify the biochemical compounds 
      extracted from OFI flowers using ultra-high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry and to evaluate their in vitro antioxidant activities and 
      anticoccidial effects on the destruction of Eimeria oocysts isolated from 
      naturally infected chickens. A domestic microwave was used with a refrigerant to 
      condense the vapors generated during the extraction. The flavonoid and phenolic 
      compound contents of the OFI flowers were determined according to standard 
      methods. DPPH radical and H(2)O(2) scavenging capacities were used to assess the 
      antioxidant activity. Regarding the anticoccidial activity, the Eimeria spp. 
      oocysts used were isolated from the fresh feces of infected broilers and were 
      determined in triplicate by incubation at an ambient temperature for 24 h. The 
      results highlighted the considerable influence of the optimized acetone 
      concentration, ratio, irradiation time, and microwave power parameters on the 
      phenolic content and antioxidant activities. Our results revealed significant 
      matches between the predicted and experimental values of the models. Molecular 
      analysis revealed the presence of several biophenol classes such as quercetin, 
      isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside, and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside. OFI flower extracts 
      inhibited sporulation and damaged the morphology of Eimeria oocysts compared with 
      normal sporulated Eimeria oocysts containing sporocysts. In conclusion, the 
      optimized conditions were validated and found to fit very well with the 
      experimental values. These findings suggest that the flowers of OFI should be 
      considered sources of antioxidants. The results of the present study revealed 
      that OFI flower extracts have anticoccidial activities against 
      Eimeria-spp.-induced infection in broiler chickens.

AB  - The microbiological and metabolic outcomes of good cocoa fermentation practices 
      can be standardized and influenced through the addition of starter culture 
      mixtures composed of yeast and bacterial strains. The present study performed two 
      spontaneous and 10 starter culture-initiated (SCI) cocoa fermentation processes 
      (CFPs) in Costa Rica with local Trinitario cocoa. The yeast strains Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae IMDO 050523, Hanseniaspora opuntiae IMDO 020003, and Pichia 
      kudriavzevii IMDO 060005 were used to compose starter culture mixtures in 
      combination with the lactic acid bacterium strain Limosilactobacillus fermentum 
      IMDO 0611222 and the acetic acid bacterium strain Acetobacter pasteurianus IMDO 
      0506386. The microbial community and metabolite dynamics of the cocoa pulp-bean 
      mass fermentation, the metabolite dynamics of the drying cocoa beans, and the 
      volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles of the chocolate production were 
      assessed. An amplicon sequence variant approach based on full-length 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing instead of targeting the V4 region led to a highly accurate 
      monitoring of the starter culture strains added, in particular the Liml. 
      fermentum IMDO 0611222 strain. The latter strain always prevailed over the 
      background lactic acid bacteria. A similar approach, based on the internal 
      transcribed spacer (ITS1) region of the fungal rRNA transcribed unit, was used 
      for yeast strain monitoring. The SCI CFPs evolved faster when compared to the 
      spontaneous ones. Moreover, the yeast strains applied did have an impact. The 
      presence of S. cerevisiae IMDO 050523 was necessary for successful fermentation 
      of the cocoa pulp-bean mass, which was characterized by the production of higher 
      alcohols and esters. In contrast, the inoculation of H. opuntiae IMDO 020003 as 
      the sole yeast strain led to underfermentation and a poor VOC profile, mainly due 
      to its low competitiveness. The P. kudriavzevii IMDO 060005 strain tested in the 
      present study did not contribute to a richer VOC profile. Although differences in 
      VOCs could be revealed in the cocoa liquors, no significant effect on the final 
      chocolates could be obtained, mainly due to a great impact of cocoa liquor 
      processing during chocolate-making. Hence, optimization of the starter culture 
      mixture and cocoa liquor processing seem to be of pivotal importance.

AB  - The scale mealybug, Diaspis echinocacti (Bouche, 1833) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), 
      is one of the main pests of the cactus pear in Brazil. The objective was to study 
      biological aspects of D. echinocacti at the constant temperatures of 25, 28, 30, 
      33 and 35  degrees C with relative humidity of 60 +/- 10% and photoperiod of 12 hours in 
      the laboratory on the cactus pear cultivar, "Orelha de Elefante Mexicana", 
      Opuntia stricta [Haw.] Haw. The development period (22 to 35 days) and survival 
      in the egg (92 to 100%) and nymph (21.8 to 100%) stages and of the egg-adult 
      cycle (20 to 100%), longevity (34.1 to 59.6 days) and fecundity (33 to 112 eggs) 
      of D. echinocacti females with the different temperature and absence of males at 
      the highest temperatures (> 30 degrees C), indicated that the range between 25  degrees C and 
      30 degrees C is the most favorable for this scale mealybug. This information may help to 
      improve integrated management programs for D. echinocacti, in areas subject to 
      seasonal temperature changes in the Brazilian regions where cactus pear is 
      cultivated.

TI  - Indicaxanthin Induces Autophagy in Intestinal Epithelial Cancer Cells by 
      Epigenetic Mechanisms Involving DNA Methylation.
LID - 10.3390/nu15153495 [doi]
LID - 3495
AB  - Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process critical in maintaining cellular 
      homeostasis. Recently, the anticancer potential of autophagy inducers, including 
      phytochemicals, was suggested. Indicaxanthin is a betalain pigment found in 
      prickly pear fruit with antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities in 
      colorectal cancer cells associated with epigenetic changes in selected 
      methylation-silenced oncosuppressor genes. Here, we demonstrate that 
      indicaxanthin induces the up-regulation of the autophagic markers LC3-II and 
      Beclin1, and increases autophagolysosome production in Caco-2 cells. Methylomic 
      studies showed that the indicaxanthin-induced pro-autophagic activity was 
      associated with epigenetic changes. In addition to acting as a hypermethylating 
      agent at the genomic level, indicaxanthin also induced significant differential 
      methylation in 39 out of 47 autophagy-related genes, particularly those involved 
      in the late stages of autophagy. Furthermore, in silico molecular modelling 
      studies suggested a direct interaction of indicaxanthin with Bcl-2, which, in 
      turn, influenced the function of Beclin1, a key autophagy regulator. External 
      effectors, including food components, may modulate the epigenetic signature of 
      cancer cells. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the pro-autophagic 
      potential of indicaxanthin in human colorectal cancer cells associated with 
      epigenetic changes and contributes to outlining its potential healthy effect in 
      the pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Increased Zygote-Derived Plantlet Formation through In Vitro Rescue of Immature 
      Embryos of Highly Apomictic Opuntia ficus-indica (Cactaceae).
LID - 10.3390/plants12152758 [doi]
LID - 2758
AB  - O. ficus-indica (prickly pear cactus) is an important forage and food source in 
      arid and semiarid ecosystems and is the most important cactus species in 
      cultivation globally. The high degree of apomixis in the species is a hindrance 
      in plant breeding programs where genetic segregation is sought for the selection 
      of superior genotypes. To understand if in ovulo embryo rescue could increase the 
      proportion of zygotic seedlings, we compared the mature seed-derived seedlings 
      with those regenerated from in vitro embryo rescue at 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 
      post-anthesis days (PADs) in four Italian cultivars. The seedlings were 
      classified as apomictic or zygotic based on molecular marker analysis using 
      inter-sequence single repeat (ISSR) primers. Multiple embryos were recovered from 
      all the cultured immature ovules, and plantlets were regenerated and acclimatized 
      to the field post hardening, with success rates ranging from 62% ('Senza spine') 
      to 83% ('Gialla'). The level of polyembryony differed among cultivars and 
      recovery dates, with the highest being 'Rossa', producing 4.8 embryos/ovule at 35 
      PADs, and 'Gialla', the lowest, with 2.7 at 40 PADs. The maximum number of 
      embryos observed within a single ovule was 14 in 'Trunzara bianca'. ISSR analysis 
      revealed that ovule culture at 35 PADs produced the highest percentage of zygotic 
      seedlings in all the cultivars, from 51% ('Rossa') to 98% ('Gialla'), with a high 
      genotype effect as well. Mature seeds produced much fewer seedlings per seed, 
      ranging from 1.2 in 'Trunzara bianca' to 2.0 in 'Rossa' and a lower percentage of 
      zygotic seedlings (from 14% in 'Rossa' to 63% in 'Gialla'). Our research opens a 
      pathway to increase the availability of zygotic seedlings in O. ficus-indica 
      breeding programs through in ovulo embryo culture.

AB  - Recently, there has been growing interest in the characterization of native 
      yeasts for their use in production of wines with regional characteristics. This 
      study aimed to investigate Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts present in 
      the spontaneous fermentation of Tannat and Marselan grape musts collected from 
      Concordia (Entre Rios, Argentina) over 2019, 2020, and 2021 vintages. The 
      evolution of these fermentative processes was carried out by measuring total 
      soluble solids, total acidity, volatile acidity, pH, ethanol concentration, and 
      total carbon content. Isolated Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts were 
      identified based on colony morphology in WL medium, 5.8S-ITS-RFLP analysis, and 
      26S rDNA D1/D2 gene sequencing. Two hundred and ten yeast colonies were isolated 
      and identified as Pichia kudriavzevii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora 
      uvarum, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Pichia 
      occidentalis, Pichia bruneiensis, Hanseniaspora opuntiae, Issatchenkia terricola, 
      and Hanseniaspora vineae. P. kudriavzevii isolated from all vintages was 
      associated with the spontaneous fermentation of grape musts from the Concordia 
      region.

TI  - Quality and sensory milk traits of goats grazing Caatinga or confined receiving 
      either corn or spineless cactus-based diets in the Brazilian semiarid 
      environment.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the yield, physical-chemical properties, fatty acid 
      (FA) profile, and sensory traits of goat milk under different nutritional 
      strategies in a Brazilian semiarid environment. Eighteen lactating crossbred 
      dairy goats were distributed in a completely randomized design with three 
      nutritional strategies: Caatinga strategy (1.5% of body weight with a concentrate 
      supplementation), Corn-based confined strategy, and Spineless Cactus confined 
      strategy. Daily milk yield was recorded, and milk samples were collected from all 
      animals. Goats fed the spineless cactus-based diet presented a higher milk yield 
      than goats feed the other strategies. Moreover, milk from goats fed with a 
      spineless Cactus confined strategy presented higher saturated FA (SFA), and a 
      lower proportion of cis- monounsaturated FA, trans-monounsaturated FA, and 
      c9,t11-18:2 than milk from goats feed the other strategies. Milk from goats in 
      the pasture system presented the highest proportions of 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, and 
      thus of polyunsaturated FA, when compared with milk from confined goats. We 
      assume that milk from goats grazing in Caatinga pastures presents more benefits 
      to human health due to the positive effects of this diet on the milk's fat 
      content and FA profile, and this feeding strategy also results in a better 
      sensory evaluation that may increase the acceptability of goat milk by consumers. 
      All nutritional strategies evaluated herein and adopted in the semiarid region of 
      Brazil are recommended for maintaining the yield, physical-chemical properties, 
      and acceptability of milk goats.

TI  - Yeasts as sustainable biocontrol agents against ochratoxigenic Aspergillus 
      species and in vitro optimization of ochratoxin A detoxification.
LID - lxad174 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jambio/lxad174 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aims of this study were to evaluate the potential of Hanseniaspora 
      opuntiae, Meyerozyma caribbica, and Kluyveromyces marxianus for in vitro 
      biocontrol of Aspergillus ochraceus, A. westerdijkiae, and A. carbonarius growth, 
      the ochratoxin A (OTA) effect on yeast growth, and yeast in vitro OTA 
      detoxification ability using an experimental design to predict the combined 
      effects of inoculum size, incubation time, and OTA concentration. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Predictive models were developed using an incomplete Box-Behnken 
      experimental design to predict the combined effects of inoculum size, incubation 
      time, and OTA concentration on OTA detoxification by the yeasts. The yeasts were 
      able to inhibit fungal growth from 13% to 86%. Kluyveromyces marxianus was the 
      most efficient in inhibiting the three Aspergillus species. Furthermore, high OTA 
      levels (100 ng ml-1) did not affect yeast growth over 72 h incubation. The models 
      showed that the maximum OTA detoxification under optimum conditions was 86.8% (H. 
      opuntiae), 79.3% (M. caribbica), and 73.7% (K. marxianus), with no significant 
      difference (P > 0.05) between the values predicted and the results obtained 
      experimentally. CONCLUSION: The yeasts showed potential for biocontrol of 
      ochratoxigenic fungi and OTA detoxification, and the models developed are 
      important tools for predicting the best conditions for the application of these 
      yeasts as detoxification agents.

TI  - Evolution of the Xerocarpa clade (Opuntia; Opuntieae): Evidence for the Role of 
      the Grand Canyon in the Biogeographic History of the Iconic Beavertail Cactus and 
      Relatives.
LID - 10.3390/plants12142677 [doi]
LID - 2677
AB  - The formation of the western North American drylands has led to the evolution of 
      an astounding diversity of species well adapted for such communities. Complex 
      historical patterns often underlie the modern distribution of the flora and fauna 
      of these areas. We investigated the biogeography of a group of desert-adapted 
      prickly pears, known as the Xerocarpa clade, from western North America. The 
      Xerocarpa clade originated in the mid-late Pliocene, likely on the Colorado 
      Plateau, and then moved south into the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts, 
      and California montane regions, further diversifying, mostly into the Quaternary. 
      The southward trajectory of the clade was likely greatly influenced by the 
      formation of the Grand Canyon. The synapomorphy of dry fruit presumably impeded 
      the long-distance dispersibility of the beavertail cactus, Opuntia basilaris, 
      while dry, spiny fruit may have enabled O. polyacantha to substantially increase 
      its distribution. Opuntia basilaris evolved a pubescent epidermis, allowing it to 
      invade hotter, drier conditions, while the spine-clothed stems of O. polyacantha 
      may have given it an advantage for increasing its northern range into colder 
      environments. The Xerocarpa clade shows a cold desert origin, and changes in 
      morphological characters have made these sister taxa well adapted for invading 
      broadscale, but oftentimes contrasting habitats.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (OF) phytochemicals have received considerable attention 
      because of their health benefits. However, the structure-activity relationship 
      between saponin and flavonoid antioxidant compounds among secondary metabolites 
      has rarely been reported. In a molecular docking study, selected compounds from 
      both Opuntia ficus-indica callus (OFC) and OF ethanol extract were found to be 
      involved in Toll-like receptor 4 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
      signaling pathways. High affinity was specific for MAPK, and it was proposed to 
      inhibit the oxidative and inflammatory responses with poricoic acid H (-8.3 
      Kcal/mol) and rutin (-9.0 Kcal/mol). The pro-inflammatory cytokine factors at a 
      concentration of 200 mug/mL were LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha (OFC 72.33 ng/mL, OF 66.78 
      ng/mL) and IL-1beta (OFC 49.10 pg/mL, OF 34.45 pg/mL), both of which significantly 
      decreased OF (p < 0.01, p < 0.001). Taken together, increased NO, PGE(2), and 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent 
      manner in cells pretreated with OFC and the OF extract (p < 0.05). These findings 
      suggest that OFC and OF have important potential as natural antioxidant, 
      anti-inflammatory agents in health-promoting foods and medicine.

AB  - Green products such as plant pigments in all filed are gaining fame globally due 
      to their excellent ayurvedic and biological characteristics. In this study, 
      microwave rays have been employed for the isolation of colorants from Anar Phali 
      while bio-mordant have been included to get color-fast shades. The colorant was 
      isolated in an acidic medium before and after microwave rays for 2 min. For 
      getting darker shades with different tints, sustainable chemical and plant-based 
      extracts as bio-mordant have been employed before and after bio coloration of 
      wool yarn at given conditions. CIE Lab system computed in 
      Colori-spectrophotometer (CS-410) was used to observe the change in color depth 
      and tonal variation of dyed fabrics, and ISO standard methods have been employed 
      to rate the colorfastness to light, washing, and rubbing at grey scale. It is 
      concluded that microwave rays have an excellent sustainable efficacy to isolate 
      colorant from Anar Phali powder for wool dyeing, whereas the addition of 
      bio-mordants has made the process more sustainable and eco-friendly.

TI  - More than a spiny morphology: plastome variation in the prickly pear cacti 
      (Opuntieae).
PG  - 771-786
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcad098 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plastid genomes (plastomes) have long been recognized as highly 
      conserved in their overall structure, size, gene arrangement and content among 
      land plants. However, recent studies have shown that some lineages present 
      unusual variations in some of these features. Members of the cactus family are 
      one of these lineages, with distinct plastome structures reported across 
      disparate lineages, including gene losses, inversions, boundary movements or loss 
      of the canonical inverted repeat (IR) region. However, only a small fraction of 
      cactus diversity has been analysed so far. METHODS: Here, we investigated 
      plastome features of the tribe Opuntieae, the remarkable prickly pear cacti, 
      which represent one of the most diverse and important lineages of Cactaceae. We 
      assembled de novo the plastome of 43 species, representing a comprehensive 
      sampling of the tribe, including all seven genera, and analysed their evolution 
      in a phylogenetic comparative framework. Phylogenomic analyses with different 
      datasets (full plastome sequences and genes only) were performed, followed by 
      congruence analyses to assess signals underlying contentious nodes. KEY RESULTS: 
      Plastomes varied considerably in length, from 121 to 162 kbp, with striking 
      differences in the content and size of the IR region (contraction and expansion 
      events), including a lack of the canonical IR in some lineages and the 
      pseudogenization or loss of some genes. Overall, nine different types of 
      plastomes were reported, deviating in the presence of the IR region or the genes 
      contained in the IR. Overall, plastome sequences resolved phylogenetic 
      relationships within major clades of Opuntieae with high bootstrap values but 
      presented some contentious nodes depending on the dataset analysed (e.g. whole 
      plastome vs. genes only). Congruence analyses revealed that most plastidial 
      regions lack phylogenetic resolution, while few markers are supporting the most 
      likely topology. Likewise, alternative topologies are driven by a handful of 
      plastome markers, suggesting recalcitrant nodes in the phylogeny. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study reveals a dynamic nature of plastome evolution across closely related 
      lineages, shedding light on peculiar features of plastomes. Variation of plastome 
      types across Opuntieae is remarkable in size, structure and content and can be 
      important for the recognition of species in some major clades. Unravelling 
      connections between the causes of plastome variation and the consequences for 
      species biology, physiology, ecology, diversification and adaptation is a 
      promising and ambitious endeavour in cactus research. Although plastome data 
      resolved major phylogenetic relationships, the generation of nuclear genomic data 
      is necessary to confront these hypotheses and assess the recalcitrant nodes 
      further.

AB  - The growing interest in a healthy lifestyle has contributed to disseminating 
      perspectives on more sustainable natural resource management. This review 
      describes promising aspects of using cacti in the food industry, addressing 
      sustainable, nutritional, and functional aspects of the plant's production. Our 
      study provides an overview of the potential of cacti for the food industry to 
      encourage the sustainable cultivation of underutilized cactus species and their 
      commercial exploitation. The commercial production of cacti has advantages over 
      other agricultural practices by mitigating damage to ecosystems and encouraging 
      migration to sustainable agriculture. The application of cactus ingredients in 
      food development has been broad, whether in producing breads, jellies, gums, 
      dyes, probiotics, and postbiotic and paraprobiotic foods. However, in the field 
      of probiotic foods, future research should focus on technologies applied in 
      processing and researching interactions between probiotics and raw materials to 
      determine the functionality and bioactivity of products.

AB  - Sicily (Italy) is the second producer of Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) fruits after 
      Mexico. To date, huge quantities of fruit are discarded during the selection for 
      the fresh market, generating a large amount of by-product to be valorized. This 
      study aimed to investigate on the composition of OFI discarded fruits from the 
      main Sicilian productive areas, over two harvesting periods. Peel, seeds and 
      whole fruit samples were characterized in terms of minerals and phenolic 
      compounds through ICP-OES and HPLC-DAD-MS. Potassium, calcium and magnesium were 
      the most abundant elements and peel samples showed the highest values. Seventeen 
      phenolic compounds were detected in peel and whole fruit, including flavonoids, 
      phenylpyruvic and hydroxycinnamic acids, while only phenolic acids were found in 
      the seeds. A multivariate chemometric approach highlighted a correlation between 
      the mineral and phenolic content and the different parts of the fruit as well as 
      a significant influence of productive area.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to carry out an ethnobotanical and 
      ethnopharmacological investigation on wild edible plants and their value to 
      households in the Tach Gayint district of South Gondar Zone of northwestern 
      Ethiopia. A total of 175 informants (56 women and 119 males) were interviewed for 
      ethnobotanical data, and 25 of them were key informants. Data collection 
      techniques included semistructured interviews, guided field walks, and focus 
      group discussions. Quantitative analytical tools were employed for ethnobotanical 
      methods including preference ranking and direct matrix ranking techniques to 
      analyse the data. 36 species of wild edible plants have been identified in the 
      study area. Of these plant species, shrubs account for 15 (42%), followed by 
      herbs 13 (36%) and trees 8 (22%). Regarding the edible parts, fruits account for 
      19 (53%) followed by young shoots, leaves, and flowers, 4 (11%) for each. These 
      plant species are eaten raw (86%) or cooked (14%) and most are collected by 
      younger people for herding cattle. According to the preference ranking analysis, 
      the fruit of Opuntia ficus-indica is the most preferred plant species because its 
      sweet taste. Although Cordia africana, the most commonly used multipurpose wild 
      edible plant species, is mostly exploited due to human activity, activities such 
      as the production of charcoal, the gathering of firewood, the construction of 
      homes, and the use of agricultural tools all played a significant role in the 
      plant's eventual extinction. In the study area, agricultural expansion was the 
      main cause of putting wild edible plants in danger. It is best to cultivate and 
      manage edible plants in a backyard garden and to perform more research on popular 
      edible plant species.

AB  - A study was undertaken to determine the effects of a strain of Arthrobacter sp., 
      a Plant Growth-Promoting Bacteria (PGPB), on plant phenology and qualitative 
      composition of Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. fruits and cladodes. The strain 
      was inoculated in soil, and its effects on cactus pear plants were detected and 
      compared to nontreated plants. Compared to the latter, the treatment with 
      bacteria promoted an earlier plant sprouting (2 months before the control) and 
      fruitification, ameliorating fruit quality (i.e., improved fresh and dry 
      weight: + 24% and + 26%, respectively, increased total solid content by 30% and 
      polyphenols concentrations by 22%). The quality and quantity of monosaccharides 
      of cladodes were also increased by Arthrobacter sp. with a positive effect on 
      their nutraceutical value. In summer, the mean values of xylose, arabinose, and 
      mannose were significantly higher in treated compared to not treated plants 
      (+ 3.54; + 7.04; + 4.76 mg/kg d.w. respectively). A similar trend was observed in 
      autumn, when the cladodes of inoculated plants had higher contents, i.e., 33% 
      xylose, 65% arabinose, and 40% mannose, respect to the controls. In conclusion, 
      Arthrobacter sp. plays a role in the improvement of nutritional and nutraceutical 
      properties of cactus pear plants due to its capabilities to promote plant growth. 
      Therefore, these results open new perspectives in PGPB application in the 
      agro-farming system as alternative strategy to improve cactus pear growth, yield, 
      and cladodes quality, being the latter the main by-product to be utilized for 
      additional industrial uses.

TI  - Beneficial Effects of Opuntia spp. on Liver Health.
LID - 10.3390/antiox12061174 [doi]
LID - 1174
AB  - The genus Opuntia spp. includes plants capable of growing in arid, temperate and 
      tropical climates. The vast majority of wild species grow in Mexico, but O. 
      ficus-indica (prickly pear or nopal) is cultivated around the world and it is one 
      of the most studied. This review shows the currently available knowledge 
      concerning the action of O. ficus-indica and other Opuntia species (Opuntia 
      vulgaris, Opuntia robusta, Opuntia streptacantha, Opuntia microdasys, Opuntia 
      dillenii and Opuntia dejecta) on liver health. The available data demonstrate the 
      positive effects of extracts, vinegar, juices or seed oil of the Opuntia genus on 
      the alterations induced in the liver by inadequate feeding patterns or the 
      administration of chemicals. In this regard, the potential beneficial effects of 
      nopal are related to the attenuation of triglyceride accumulation, oxidative 
      stress and/or inflammation. Nevertheless, there is no information concerning the 
      bioactive compound's characterisation in most of these studies; consequently, it 
      is not possible to link the therapeutic effects of these plants to the presence 
      of specific compounds in the nopal extracts. Therefore, further research is 
      needed to confirm if the positive effects observed in animal models are also 
      found in humans, in order to determine whether Opuntia can represent an effective 
      tool to prevent and/or manage hepatic alterations.

AB  - Rapid ripening and softening due to cell wall polysaccharide degradation and 
      disassembly pose major challenges in extending fruit storability. This study 
      aimed to examine the efficacy of Opuntia ficus indica mucilage (OFIM) edible 
      coating in minimizing softening in bananas under retail conditions. Mucilage was 
      extracted from freshly harvested prickly pear cladodes and dried into a powder. 
      Phenolic compounds in OFIM powder were quantified using liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). OFIM concentrations (1, 2 and 3 % 
      (w/v)) were prepared, and their physicochemical properties were examined. The 
      prepared coatings were applied to harvested banana fruit by dipping and stored at 
      room temperature for 12 days. During the experiment, several parameters were 
      measured, including fruit weight loss, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable 
      acidity (TA), peel color, pulp firmness, ethylene production, respiration rate, 
      ion leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, total chlorophyll and carotenoids, 
      chlorophyll-degrading enzymes, protopectin content and water-soluble pectin (WSP) 
      and softening-related enzymes in the peel. Results showed that mucilage 
      treatments effectively delayed cell wall and chlorophyll degradation, as well as 
      carotenoid accumulation, thus inhibiting ripening-associated processes compared 
      to control fruit. OFIM-treated fruit exhibited significantly higher firmness, 
      chlorophyll content, and TA, lower TSS content, ethylene production, respiration 
      rate, MDA concentration, ion leakage and protopectin content than uncoated fruit. 
      This suggests that OFIM edible coating has the potential to maintain quality and 
      extend the shelf life of bananas by suppressing softening enzymes during storage.

AB  - We aim to develop an electrochemical sensor for a divalent metal ion (lead II), a 
      highly toxic water contaminant. We explore a sensor formed with a hemicellulose 
      polysaccharide extracted from the Opuntia Ficus Indica cactus associated with 
      agarose as a sensitive layer deposited on a gold electrode. This sensor combines 
      the functional groups of hemicellulose that could form a complex with metal ions 
      and agarose with gelling properties to form a stable membrane. The sensor 
      demonstrated a loading ability of Pb(2+), with higher affinity compared to other 
      metal ions such as Hg(2+), Ni(2+,) and Cu(2+), thanks to the chemical structure 
      of hemicellulose. The detection was measured by square wave voltammetry based on 
      a well-defined redox peak of the metal ions. The sensor shows high sensitivity 
      towards Pb(2+) with a detection limit of 1.3 fM. The application in river and sea 
      water using the standard addition method for lead detection was studied.

TI  - Single and Binary Removals of Pb(II) and Cd(II) with Chemically Modified Opuntia 
      ficus indica Cladodes.
LID - 10.3390/molecules28114451 [doi]
LID - 4451
AB  - In this study, cladodes of Opuntia ficus indica (OFIC), chemically modified with 
      NaOH (OFICM), have been prepared, characterized, and tested as an effective 
      biomass to remove Pb(II) and/or Cd(II) from aqueous media. At an optimum pH of 
      4.5, the adsorption capacity, q(e), of treated OFICM was almost four times higher 
      than that of untreated OFIC. The maximum adsorption capacities (q(max)) in the 
      single removal of Pb(II) and Cd(II) were 116.8 and 64.7 mg g(-1), respectively. 
      These values were 12.1% and 70.6% higher than those for the corresponding q(max) 
      in binary removal, which indicates the strong inhibitive effect of Pb(II) on the 
      co-cation Cd(II) in a binary system. Structural and morphological 
      characterization have been carried out by FTIR, SEM/EDX, and point of zero charge 
      (pH(PZC)) measurements. The SEM/EDX results confirmed that the metals are 
      adsorbed on the surface. The presence of C-O, C=O, and COO- functional groups 
      were identified by FTIR on both OFIC and OFICM surfaces. On the other hand, we 
      found that the adsorption processes followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics for 
      both single and binary systems, with a fast biosorption rate of Pb(II) and 
      Cd(II). The equilibrium data (adsorption isotherms) were better described by 
      Langmuir and modified-Langmuir models for single and binary systems, 
      respectively. A good regeneration of OFICM was obtained with an eluent of 0.1 M 
      HNO(3). Therefore, OFICM can be efficiently reused to remove Pb or Cd, up to 
      three times.

TI  - A Bioactive Compound-Loaded Zinc-Aminoclay Encapsulated, Pickering Emulsion 
      System for Treating Acne-Inducing Microbes.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24119669 [doi]
LID - 9669
AB  - Acne is a common skin condition caused by the growth of certain bacteria. Many 
      plant extracts have been investigated for their potential to combat acne-inducing 
      microbes, and one such plant extract is microwave-assisted Opuntia humifusa 
      extract (MA-OHE). The MA-OHE was loaded onto zinc-aminoclay (ZnAC) and 
      encapsulated in a Pickering emulsion system (MA-OHE/ZnAC PE) to evaluate its 
      therapeutic potential against acne-inducing microbes. Dynamic light scattering 
      and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize MA-OHE/ZnAC PE with a 
      mean particle diameter of 353.97 nm and a PDI of 0.629. The antimicrobial effect 
      of MA-OHE/ZnAC was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and 
      Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes), which contribute to acne inflammation. The 
      antibacterial activity of MA-OHE/ZnAC was 0.1 and 0.025 mg/mL to S. aureus and C. 
      acnes, respectively, which were close to naturally derived antibiotics. 
      Additionally, the cytotoxicity of MA-OHE, ZnAC, and MA-OHE/ZnAC was tested, and 
      the results showed that they had no cytotoxic effects on cultured human 
      keratinocytes in a range of 10-100 mug/mL. Thus, MA-OHE/ZnAC is suggested to be a 
      promising antimicrobial agent for treating acne-inducing microbes, while 
      MA-OHE/ZnAC PE is a potentially advantageous dermal delivery system.

TI  - Oil-Based Double Emulsion Microcarriers for Enhanced Stability and 
      Bioaccessibility of Betalains and Phenolic Compounds from Opuntia stricta var. 
      dillenii Green Extracts.
LID - 10.3390/foods12112243 [doi]

AB  - Opuntia cactus fruit (prickly pear flesh and agricultural residues such as peels 
      and stalks) is an important source of bioactive compounds, including betalains 
      and phenolic compounds. In this work, two double emulsion W(1)/O/W(2) 
      formulations (A and B) were designed to encapsulate green extracts rich in 
      betalains and phenolic compounds obtained from Opuntia stricta var. dillenii 
      (OPD) fruits with the aim of improving their stability and protecting them during 
      the in vitro gastrointestinal digestion process. In addition, the 
      characterization of the double emulsions was studied by microscopy and the 
      evaluation of their physical and physico-chemical parameters. Formulation A, 
      based on Tween 20, showed smaller droplets (1.75 microm) and a higher physical 
      stability than Formulation B, which was achieved with sodium caseinate (29.03 
      microm). Regarding the encapsulation efficiency of the individual bioactives, 
      betalains showed the highest values (73.7 +/- 6.7 to 96.9 +/- 3.3%), followed by 
      flavonoids (68.2 +/- 5.9 to 95.9 +/- 7.7%) and piscidic acid (71 +/- 1.3 to 70.2 +/- 
      5.7%) depending on the formulation and the bioactive compound. In vitro digestive 
      stability and bioaccessibility of the individual bioactives increased when 
      extracts were encapsulated for both formulations (67.1 to 253.1%) in comparison 
      with the non-encapsulated ones (30.1 to 64.3%), except for neobetanin. Both 
      formulations could be considered as appropriate microcarrier systems for green 
      OPD extracts, especially formulation A. Further studies need to be conducted 
      about the incorporation of these formulations to develop healthier foods.

      Phytochemical Composition of Opuntia ficus-indica Juices.
LID - 10.3390/foods12112096 [doi]
LID - 2096
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica fruits are a source of valuable compounds, presenting a high 
      nutritional value and several health benefits. However, due to its low shelf life 
      and increased production, there are considerable post-harvest losses of this 
      cactus fruit. So, ways need to be found to drain the increased production of this 
      fruit that is being wasted. The chemical composition of prickly pear makes it an 
      appealing substrate for fermentation. This study investigates the production of 
      fermented beverages produced from Opuntia ficus-indica cv 'Rossa' and evaluates 
      the effects of different fermentation times (18 and 42 h) and post-fermentation 
      pasteurization by high-pressure (500 MPa for 10 min) and temperature (71.1  degrees C for 
      30 s) on the physico-chemical and biological characteristics of the produced 
      beverages. According to the results, the beverage produced from 48 h of 
      fermentation has an alcohol content value of 4.90 +/- 0.08% (v/v) and a pH of 3.91 
      +/- 0.03. These values contribute to an extended shelf life and improved 
      organoleptic characteristics compared to the sample fermented for 18 h. 
      Additionally, the longer fermentation resulted in 50% fewer total soluble solids, 
      90% less turbidity, and lower pH when compared to the sample fermented for 18 h. 
      Moreover, overall, high-pressure processing demonstrates better retention of 
      "fresh-like" characteristics, along with higher levels of phytochemical compounds 
      and antioxidant capacity, similar to those observed in the juice for SO(*)- and 
      NO(*)-scavenging abilities.

AB  - With the steady increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods, there is 
      growing interest in sustainable diets that include more plant protein. However, 
      little information is available regarding the structural and functional 
      properties of cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) seed protein (CSP), a by-product of 
      the cactus seed food-processing chain. This study aimed to explore the 
      composition and nutritional value of CSP and reveal the effects of ultrasound 
      treatment on protein quality. Protein chemical structure analysis showed that an 
      appropriate intensity of ultrasound treatment (450 W) could significantly 
      increase protein solubility (96.46 +/- 2.07%) and surface hydrophobicity 
      (13.76 +/- 0.85 mug), decrease the content of T-SH (50.25 +/- 0.79 mumol/g) and free-SH 
      (8.60 +/- 0.30 mumol/g), and enhance emulsification characteristics. Circular 
      dichroism analysis further confirmed that the ultrasonic treatment increased the 
      alpha-helix and random coil content. Amino acid analysis also suggested that 
      ultrasound treatment (450 W) increased the hydrophobic amino acid content. To 
      evaluate the impact of changes in the chemical structure, its digestion behavior 
      was studied. The results showed that ultrasound treatment increased the release 
      rate of free amino acids. Furthermore, nutritional analysis showed that the 
      digestive products of CSP by ultrasound treatment can significantly enhance the 
      intestinal permeability, increase the expression of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1, 
      thus repairing LPS induced intestinal barrier disfunction. Hence, CSP is a 
      functional protein with high value, and ultrasound treatment is recommended. 
      These findings provide new insights into the comprehensive utilization of cactus 
      fruits.

AB  - Cactus is a tropical fruit with a high nutritional value; however, little 
      information is available regarding the comprehensive utilization of its 
      byproducts. This study aimed to explore the composition and nutritional value of 
      cactus fruit seed oil (CFO) and reveal the effects of ultrasound-assisted 
      extraction and traditional solvent extraction on oil quality. Foodomics analysis 
      showed that CFO extracted using a traditional solvent is rich in linolenic acid 
      (9c12cC18:2, 57.46 +/- 0.84 %), alpha-tocopherol (20.01 +/- 1.86 mg/100 g oil), and 
      canolol (200.10 +/- 1.21 mug/g). Compared to traditional solvent extraction, 
      ultrasound-assisted extraction can significantly increase the content of lipid 
      concomitants in CFO, whereas excessive ultrasound intensity may lead to the 
      oxidation of oils and the formation of free radicals. Analysis of the thermal 
      properties showed that ultrasound had no effect on the crystallization or melting 
      behavior of CFO. To further demonstrate the nutritional value of CFO, a 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lipid metabolism imbalance model was used. 
      Lipidomics analysis showed that CFO significantly reduced the content of oxidized 
      phospholipids stimulated by LPS and increased the content of highly bioactive 
      metabolites such as ceramides, thus alleviating LPS-induced damage in C. elegans. 
      Hence, CFO is a functional oil with high value, and ultrasound-assisted 
      extraction is advocated. These findings provide new insights into the 
      comprehensive utilization of cactus fruits.

TI  - Developmental dynamics of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) in Opuntia 
      ficus-indica.
PG  - 869-879
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcad070 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The relative contributions of C3 photosynthesis and 
      crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) during the earliest stages of development were 
      investigated to assess how much each might contribute to cactus pear (Opuntia 
      ficus-indica) productivity. METHODS: The developmental progression of C3 
      photosynthesis and CAM was assessed in seedlings and daughter cladodes of mature 
      plants by titratable acidity, delta13C isotopic values and diel gas exchange 
      measurements. KEY RESULTS: Nocturnal acidification was observed in seedling 
      cladodes and cotyledons at the earliest stages of development and became highly 
      significant by 75 days of development. Seedling cotyledons showed mean delta13C 
      values of -21.4 and -17.1  per thousand at 30 and 100 days of age, respectively. Seedling 
      cladodes showed mean delta13C values of -19.4 and -14.5  per thousand at 30 and 100 days of age, 
      respectively. These values are typical of CAM plants. Net CO2 assimilation was 
      negative, then occurred in both the day and the night, with nighttime fixation 
      becoming predominant once the primary cladode reached 5 cm in size. Emergent 
      daughter cladodes growing on mature plants showed nocturnal titratable acidity at 
      the earliest stages of development, which became significant when daughter 
      cladodes were >2.5-5 cm in height. Emergent daughter cladodes showed mean delta13C 
      values of -14.5 to -15.6  per thousand, typical of CAM plants. CO2 assimilation studies 
      revealed that net CO2 uptake was negative in daughter cladodes <12 cm in length, 
      but then exhibited net positive CO2 assimilation in both the day and the night, 
      with net nocturnal CO2 assimilation predominating once the daughter cladode grew 
      larger. CONCLUSIONS: Developing O. ficus-indica primary and daughter cladodes 
      begin as respiring sink tissues that transition directly to performing CAM once 
      net positive CO2 fixation is observed. Overall, these results demonstrate that 
      CAM is the primary form of photosynthetic carbon assimilation for O. ficus-indica 
      even at the earliest stages of seedling or daughter cladode development.

TI  - The Effect of Netting Bags on the Postharvest Quality, Bioactive and Nutritional 
      Compounds, and the Spoilage Microorganisms Content of Bell Peppers.
LID - 10.3390/foods12102071 [doi]
LID - 2071
AB  - The packaging nets used for bell peppers act as a form of protection. However, 
      the manufacturing is based on polymers that cause serious environmental problems. 
      The effects of nets made of biodegradable materials, such as poly(lactic) acid 
      (PLA), poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), and cactus stem residues, 
      were evaluated on four different colors of 'California Wonder' bell peppers 
      stored over a 25-day storage period under controlled and ambient temperature 
      conditions. Compared to commercial polyethylene nets, the bell peppers kept in 
      the biodegradable nets did not show notable differences with respect to color, 
      weight loss, total soluble solids, and titratable acidity. However, there were 
      significant differences (p < 0.05) in terms of phenol content, carotenoids 
      (orange bell peppers), anthocyanins, and vitamin C, with an overall tendency to 
      show a higher content in those kept in PLA 60%/PBTA 40%/cactus stem flour 3% 
      compared to commercial packaging. In addition, the same net notably reduced the 
      development of bacteria, fungi, and yeasts during the storage of red, orange, and 
      yellow bell peppers. As postharvest packaging for bell peppers, this net could be 
      considered a viable option for the storage of this product.

TI  - Bacterial and Fungal Communities Are Specifically Modulated by the Cocoa Bean 
      Fermentation Method.
LID - 10.3390/foods12102024 [doi]
LID - 2024
AB  - Cocoa bean fermentation is carried out in different production areas following 
      various methods. This study aimed to assess how the bacterial and fungal 
      communities were affected by box, ground or jute fermentation methods, using 
      high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of phylogenetic amplicons. Moreover, an 
      evaluation of the preferable fermentation method was carried out based on the 
      microbial dynamics observed. Box fermentation resulted in higher bacterial 
      species diversity, while beans processed on the ground had a wider fungal 
      community. Lactobacillus fermentum and Pichia kudriavzevii were observed in all 
      three fermentation methods studied. Moreover, Acetobacter tropicalis dominated 
      box fermentation and Pseudomonas fluorescens abounded in ground-fermented 
      samples. Hanseniaspora opuntiae was the most important yeast in jute and box, 
      while Saccharomyces cerevisiae prevailed in the box and ground fermentation. 
      PICRUST analysis was performed to identify potential interesting pathways. In 
      conclusion, there were noticeable differences between the three different 
      fermentation methods. Due to its limited microbial diversity and the presence of 
      microorganisms that guarantee good fermentation, the box method was found to be 
      preferable. Moreover, the present study allowed us to thoroughly explore the 
      microbiota of differently treated cocoa beans and to better understand the 
      technological processes useful to obtain a standardized end-product.

TI  - Decellularized Scaffolds of Nopal (Opuntia Ficus-indica) for Bioengineering in 
      Regenerative Dentistry.
LID - 10.3390/jfb14050252 [doi]
LID - 252
AB  - Opuntia Ficus-indica, or nopal, is traditionally used for its medicinal 
      properties in Mexico. This study aims to decellularize and characterize nopal 
      (Opuntia Ficus-indica) scaffolds, assess their degradation and the proliferation 
      of hDPSC, and determine potential pro-inflammatory effects by assessing the 
      expression of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and 2). The scaffolds were 
      decellularized using a 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution and confirmed 
      by color, optical microscopy, and SEM. The degradation rates and mechanical 
      properties of the scaffolds were determined by weight and solution absorbances 
      using trypsin and PBS and tensile strength testing. Human dental pulp stem cells 
      (hDPSCs) primary cells were used for scaffold-cell interaction and proliferation 
      assays, as well as an MTT assay to determine proliferation. Proinflammatory 
      protein expression of COX-I and -II was discovered by Western blot assay, and the 
      cultures were induced into a pro-inflammatory state with interleukin 1-beta. The 
      nopal scaffolds exhibited a porous structure with an average pore size of 252 +/- 
      77 mum. The decellularized scaffolds showed a 57% reduction in weight loss during 
      hydrolytic degradation and a 70% reduction during enzymatic degradation. There 
      was no difference in tensile strengths between native and decellularized 
      scaffolds (12.5 +/- 1 and 11.8 +/- 0.5 MPa). Furthermore, hDPSCs showed a significant 
      increase in cell viability of 95% and 106% at 168 h for native and decellularized 
      scaffolds, respectively. The combination of the scaffold and hDPSCs did not cause 
      an increase in the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 proteins. However, when the 
      combination was exposed to IL-1beta, there was an increase in the expression of 
      COX-2. This study demonstrates the potential application of nopal scaffolds in 
      tissue engineering and regenerative medicine or dentistry, owing to their 
      structural characteristics, degradation properties, mechanical properties, 
      ability to induce cell proliferation, and lack of enhancement of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines.

TI  - Untreated Opuntia ficus indica for the Efficient Adsorption of Ni(II), Pb(II), 
      Cu(II) and Cd(II) Ions from Water.
LID - 10.3390/molecules28093953 [doi]

AB  - The raw cladode of Opuntia ficus indica (OFI) was evaluated as a sustainable 
      biosorbent for the removal of heavy metals (Ni, Pb, Cu, and Cd) from aqueous 
      solutions. The functional groups of OFI were identified by employing DRIFT-FTIR 
      and CP-MAS-NMR techniques before and after contact with the ions in an aqueous 
      media, showing a rearrangement of the biomass structure due to the complexation 
      between the metal and the functional groups. The adsorption process was studied 
      in both single- and multi-component systems under batch conditions at different 
      pHs (4.0, 5.0, and 6.0), different metal concentrations, and different biomass 
      amounts. The results show that the raw OFI had a removal capacity at room 
      temperature of over 80% for all metals studied after only 30 min of contact time, 
      indicating a rapid adsorption process. Biosorption kinetics were successfully 
      fitted by the pseudo-second-order equation, while Freundlich correctly modelled 
      the biosorption data at equilibrium. The results of this work highlight the 
      potential use of the untreated cladode of OFI as an economical and 
      environmentally friendly biosorbent for the removal of heavy metals from the 
      contaminated aqueous solution.

TI  - Spray-Drying Microencapsulation of Andean Blueberry (Vaccinium meridionale Sw.) 
      Anthocyanins Using Prickly Pear (Opuntia ficus indica L.) Peel Mucilage or Gum 
      Arabic: A Comparative Study.

AB  - The recovery of byproducts from the food industry is a promising approach to 
      obtain hydrophilic biopolymers with potential health benefits. In this work, the 
      mucilage obtained from the peel of the Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) fruit was 
      compared with gum arabic (GA) as wall materials for the microencapsulation of 
      Colombian blueberry anthocyanins, using the spray-drying process. For both types 
      of microencapsulates, the following were determined: anthocyanin content (UV-vis 
      and HPLC/MS-MS), total dietary content (enzymatic-gravimetric method), 
      antioxidant activity (ORAC), color (CIELab parameters), morphology (SEM and 
      particle size), and thermal behavior (DSC/TGA). Six different anthocyanins were 
      identified by HPLC/MS-MS in the non-lyophilized Andean blueberry sample (LABP) 
      and in the OFI-mucilage and GA microcapsules. OFI mucilage, compared to GA, 
      favors the formation of larger spherical particles, a smoother surface without 
      cracks, and greater thermal stability. The higher anthocyanin retention capacity 
      in OFI microcapsules leads to higher antioxidant capacity and red coloration for 
      this biomaterial. Consequently, the microencapsulation of anthocyanins with 
      mucilage from the peel of the OFI fruit is proposed as a promising alternative 
      for the protection and incorporation of this natural dye with high antioxidant 
      capacity and dietary fiber content in new functional food/cosmetic formulations, 
      while giving added value to the natural byproducts of OFI.

TI  - Confessions of a baboon watcher: from inside to outside the paradigm.
PG  - 393-406
LID - 10.1007/s10329-023-01060-1 [doi]
AB  - In this "tale" I summarize the major landmarks of my 50-year career watching wild 
      olive baboons (Papio anubis). I review some major discoveries, like baboon 
      hunting and baboon social strategies of competition and defense, that only a 
      creature with a "mind" could manage. My efforts expanded beyond science to 
      include community-based conservation because quite early on these baboons 
      experienced many of the threats of the Anthropocene. My research expanded to 
      include studying crop-raiding by naive groups of baboons, the first scientific 
      translocation of a primate species, and a detour to study the invasion of a 
      non-indigenous cactus, Opuntia stricta. Throughout I worked with local 
      communities to find solutions to problems that the baboons created, and also to 
      develop new options for their livelihoods. As the baboon research became a 
      long-term project, it depended on a team of Kenyan research assistants who made 
      possible the simultaneous monitoring of up to six baboon troops as well as 
      extensive ecological monitoring. Knowing the ecology, including the impact of the 
      sedentarization of pastoralists in the area, meant we could interpret the process 
      of invasion by a non-indigenous cactus for the first time. Ecological periods 
      allowed comparisons of the same troop over time and different baboon groups 
      during the same ecological phase. Although I began my work before hypothesis 
      testing was the preferred approach, once the paradigm changed, I continued to 
      study and learn what matters to baboons from their perspective. As a result of 
      observing them for 50 years, the baboons showed me that evolution often does not 
      work the way that I had been taught, and it took all my detours and studies to 
      convince me that anecdotes, when they are systematic and comparative, are not 
      stories to be discounted, but evidence, much like Darwin's natural history. 
      Natural history can reassemble the pieces that quantitative hypothesis testing 
      has teased apart to provide its larger meaning. Today, the lone scientist, like 
      me, is an anachronism because no one person has expertise in the many fields 
      needed to understand and save the primates we care about.

TI  - Predicting geographic distribution and habitat suitability of Opuntia 
      streptacantha in paleoclimatic, current, and future scenarios in Mexico.
PG  - e10050
LID - 10.1002/ece3.10050 [doi]
LID - e10050
AB  - Mexican territory is one of the centers of origin and dispersion of the genus 
      Opuntia, where several of its species have been an important plant resource for 
      people in arid and semiarid zones. Opuntia streptacantha is widely distributed in 
      Mexico; however, precise aspects of its geographic distribution and ecological 
      status are still unknown. Here, we modeled its potential distribution under 
      paleoclimatic, current, and future conditions through maximum entropy and 
      predictions from 824 records and seven environmental variables. Potential 
      distribution of O. streptacantha in the interglacial period was contracted and 
      slightly north than current distribution, with 44,773 km(2) of optimal habitat. 
      In other past periods, the central location of potential distribution coincides 
      with the actual current distribution, but the period of the last glacial maximum 
      was characterized by 201 km(2) of very suitable habitat, absent in interglacial, 
      current, and future periods. The future model suggests that potential 
      distribution will move toward the south of the Mexican territory. Synthesis and 
      applications. The potential distribution of O. streptacantha can be applied for 
      the conservation and management of the species, and also in the selection of 
      areas with crassicaule scrubs for protection, conservation, and reproduction of 
      species resistant to the hostile conditions of arid and semiarid zones of Mexican 
      territory, where the structure and composition of the vegetation will be affected 
      in the next 100 years.

TI  - Structures, Sources, Identification/Quantification Methods, Health Benefits, 
      Bioaccessibility, and Products of Isorhamnetin Glycosides as Phytonutrients.
LID - 10.3390/nu15081947 [doi]

AB  - In recent years, people have tended to consume phytonutrients and nutrients in 
      their daily diets. Isorhamnetin glycosides (IGs) are an essential class of 
      flavonoids derived from dietary and medicinal plants such as Opuntia 
      ficus-indica, Hippophae rhamnoides, and Ginkgo biloba. This review summarizes the 
      structures, sources, quantitative and qualitative analysis technologies, health 
      benefits, bioaccessibility, and marketed products of IGs. Routine and innovative 
      assay methods, such as IR, TLC, NMR, UV, MS, HPLC, UPLC, and HSCCC, have been 
      widely used for the characterization and quantification of IGs. All of the 
      therapeutic effects of IGs discovered to date are collected and discussed in this 
      study, with an emphasis on the relevant mechanisms of their health-promoting 
      effects. IGs exhibit diverse biological activities against cancer, diabetes, 
      hepatic diseases, obesity, and thrombosis. They exert therapeutic effects through 
      multiple networks of underlying molecular signaling pathways. Owing to these 
      benefits, IGs could be utilized to make foods and functional foods. IGs exhibit 
      higher bioaccessibility and plasma concentrations and longer average residence 
      time in blood than aglycones. Overall, IGs as phytonutrients are very promising 
      and have excellent application potential.

TI  - An Approach to Evaluate Pb Tolerance and Its Removal Mechanisms by Pleurotus 
      opuntiae.
LID - 10.3390/jof9040405 [doi]
LID - 405
AB  - Widespread lead (Pb) contamination prompts various environmental problems and 
      accounts for about 1% of the global disease burden. Thus, it has necessitated the 
      demand for eco-friendly clean-up approaches. Fungi provide a novel and highly 
      promising approach for the remediation of Pb-containing wastewater. The current 
      study examined the mycoremediation capability of a white rot fungus, P. opuntiae, 
      that showed effective tolerance to increasing concentrations of Pb up to 200 mg 
      L(-1), evidenced by the Tolerance Index (TI) of 0.76. In an aqueous medium, the 
      highest removal rate (99.08%) was recorded at 200 mg L(-1) whereas intracellular 
      bioaccumulation also contributed to the uptake of Pb in significant amounts with 
      a maximum of 24.59 mg g(-1). SEM was performed to characterize the mycelium, 
      suggesting changes in the surface morphology after exposure to high Pb 
      concentrations. LIBS indicated a gradual change in the intensity of some elements 
      after exposure to Pb stress. FTIR spectra displayed many functional groups 
      including amides, sulfhydryl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups on the cell walls 
      that led to binding sites for Pb and indicated the involvement of these groups in 
      biosorption. XRD analysis unveiled a mechanism of biotransformation by forming a 
      mineral complex as PbS from Pb ion. Further, Pb fostered the level of proline and 
      MDA at a maximum relative to the control, and their concentration reached 1.07 
      micromol g(-1) and 8.77 nmol g(-1), respectively. High Pb concentration results in 
      oxidative damage by increasing the production of ROS. Therefore, the antioxidant 
      enzyme system provides a central role in the elimination of active oxygen. The 
      enzymes, namely SOD, POD, CAT, and GSH, served as most responsive to clear away 
      ROS and lower the stress. The results of this study suggested that the presence 
      of Pb caused no visible adverse symptoms in P. opuntiae. Moreover, biosorption 
      and bioaccumulation are two essential approaches involved in Pb removal by P. 
      opuntiae and are established as worthwhile agents for the remediation of Pb from 
      the environment.

AB  - Recently, researchers have focused on the use of natural antioxidants to improve 
      semen quality as a key element for successful artificial insemination. In this 
      context, the first aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant activity 
      and composition (minerals, vitamins, and sugars) of Opuntia ficus-indica cladode 
      ethanolic extract (ETHEX). A further purpose of the study was to investigate the 
      effect of ETHEX supplementation on the quality of liquid ram semen extended with 
      skim milk (SM) at 5 degrees C. The antioxidant activity of ETHEX was studied using free 
      radical 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH*) assay. The mineral composition and 
      the sugar and vitamin contents of ETHEX were determined using an inductively 
      coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and HPLC-DAD-RID 
      analytical instruments. As a second part, semen was collected from five Boujaad 
      rams with an artificial vagina. The ejaculates with more than 70% motility were 
      pooled, extended with skim milk (SM) extender without (control) or supplemented 
      with 1-8% of ETHEX (37 degrees C; 0.8 x 109 sperm/mL). Sperm quality parameters were 
      assessed at 8, 24, 48, and 72 h. The results showed that ETHEX had a higher 
      antioxidant activity compared to those of ascorbic acid and butylated 
      hydroxytoluene (BHT). Furthermore, ETHEX contains a considerable amount of 
      minerals, vitamins, and sugars. The inclusion of 1 or 2% ETHEX in SM increased 
      the sperm motility, viability, and membrane integrity and decreased the 
      abnormality of spontaneous and catalyzed lipids peroxidation (p < 0.05) up to 
      72 h. In addition, semen diluted with 1 and 2% ETHEX decreased the level of DNA 
      fragmentation compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the ETHEX 
      could be recommended to improve the quality of liquid ram spermatozoa. However, 
      its effects on artificial insemination should be further studied.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Opuntia speciesis used in traditional medicine to 
      treat diabetes mellitus (DM). Polysaccharide is one of the main components of 
      Opuntia. Opuntia polysaccharide (OPS) is a kind of natural active macromolecular 
      substance, numerous animal experiments have been conducted to treat DM, however, 
      its protective effect and mechanism in animal models of DM has not been 
      clarified. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 
      OPS on DM through a stematic review and meta-analysis of animal models, and 
      whether its improves blood glucose (BG) levels, body weight (BW), food intake, 
      water intake, and lipid levels, and to summarize the potential mechanism of OPS 
      in the treatment of DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched relevant Chinese and 
      English databases from the date of construction to March 2022, including PubMed 
      (MEDLINE), Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science, China National 
      Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM), 
      Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals Database (VIP), Wanfang Database. 16 
      studies were included for meta-analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that 
      compared with the model group, the OPS significantly improved BG, BW, food 
      intake, water intake, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). 
      Meta-regression and subgroup analysis showed that intervention dose, animal 
      species, duration and modeling method may be the source of the heterogeneity. 
      There was no statistical difference between the positive control group and the 
      OPS treatment group in improving BW, food intake, water intake, TC, TG, HDL-C, 
      and LDL-C. CONCLUSIONS: OPS can effectively improve the symptoms of 
      hyperglycemia, polydipsia, polyphagia, low body weight, and dyslipidemia in DM 
      animals. The possible protective mechanisms of OPS on DM animals are immune 
      regulation, repair of damaged pancreatic beta cells, and inhibition of oxidative 
      stress and cell apoptosis.

TI  - Phytochemical profiling, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities of 
      hydroethanolic extracts of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus indica) fruit and pulp.

AB  - Phenolic compounds in prickly pear [Opuntia ficus indica (L.) Mill.] are known to 
      contribute to the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the prickly pear. 
      The present study aimed to evaluate the antioxidants and in vitro antimicrobial 
      potential in the hydroethanolic extracts of different parts (fruit, cladode, and 
      pulp) of prickly pear. Different polyphenolic compounds were analyzed by using 
      high-performance liquid chromatography. The results indicated that cladode 
      possessed a higher quantity of phenolics compared with that observed in fruit and 
      pulp. The most important phenolic compound in high quantity was gallic acid 
      (66.19 mug/g) in cladode. The 100% aqueous extract of cladode exhibited the 
      highest antioxidant (92%) and antimicrobial activities against Salmonella typhi 
      (3.40 mg/ml), Helicobacter pylori (1.37 mg/ml), Escherichia coli (1.41 mg/ml), 
      and Staphylococcus aureus (1.41 mg/ml). Principal component analysis (PCA) 
      indicated that antioxidant activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
      responses had a significant negative correlation with each other. Overall, the 
      current results provided basic data for choosing prickly pear cladode with high 
      antioxidant capacity for the development and consumption of antioxidant-based 
      alternative medicines and value addition of formulated foods.

TI  - Phytochemical Analysis and Genotoxicological Evaluation of Prickly Pear Peel 
      Extracts.
LID - 10.3390/plants12071537 [doi]
LID - 1537
AB  - This study investigated the beneficial properties of prickly pear peel (PPP) 
      extracts from Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. Extracts were obtained via the 
      Soxhlet extraction method using methanol (P1), ethanol (P2) and ethanol-water 
      (P3) as extraction solvents. Their total phenolic and flavonoid content (TPC and 
      TFC, respectively) and their antioxidant activity (AA) were determined. The PPP 
      extracts were characterized in detail using mass spectrometry techniques. Their 
      cyto-genotoxic effect and antigenotoxic potential against mitomycin C were 
      evaluated via the cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assay on human 
      lymphocytes. Enhanced TPC, TFC and AA values were recorded for all the extracts. 
      Moreover, P1 and P2 were cytotoxic only at the highest concentrations, whereas P3 
      was found to be cytotoxic in all cases. No significant micronucleus induction was 
      observed in the tested extracts. The PPP extracts contain bioactive compounds 
      such as flavonoids, carboxylic acids, alkaloids, fatty acids and minerals (mainly 
      K, Si, Mg, Ca, P and Zn). The results showed that all three extracts exerted high 
      antigenotoxic activity. Our findings confirm the beneficial and genoprotective 
      properties of PPP extracts and further studies on the bioactive compounds of 
      Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. are recommended, as it constitutes a promising 
      plant in pharmaceutical applications.

TI  - Opuntia spp.: An Overview of the Bioactive Profile and Food Applications of This 
      Versatile Crop Adapted to Arid Lands.
LID - 10.3390/foods12071465 [doi]
LID - 1465
AB  - Opuntia spp. are crops well adapted to adverse environments and have great 
      economic potential. Their constituents, including fruits, cladodes, and flowers, 
      have a high nutritional value and are rich in value-added compounds. Cladodes 
      have an appreciable content in dietary fiber, as well as bioactive compounds such 
      as kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin. Fruits are a major source of 
      bioactive compounds such as phenolic acids and vitamin C. The seeds are mainly 
      composed of unsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E. The flowers are also rich in 
      phenolic compounds. Therefore, in addition to their traditional uses, the 
      different plant fractions can be processed to meet multiple applications in the 
      food industry. Several bakery products have been developed with the incorporation 
      of cladode flour. Pectin and mucilage obtained from cladodes can act as edible 
      films and coatings. Fruits, fruit extracts, and fruit by-products have been mixed 
      into food products, increasing their antioxidant capacity and extending their 
      shelf life. Betalains, obtained from fruits, can be used as food colorants and 
      demonstrate promising applications as a sensor in food packaging. This work 
      reviews the most valuable components of the different fractions of this plant and 
      emphasizes its most recent food applications, demonstrating its outstanding 
      value.

TI  - Modeling impacts of climate change on the distribution of invasive Opuntia 
      ficus-indica (L.) Mill. in Ethiopia: Implications on biodiversity conservation.
PG  - e14927
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14927 [doi]
LID - e14927
AB  - The main danger to biological diversity is the introduction of exotic species. 
      Opuntia ficus-indica (O. ficus-indica) is a dangerous invasive species that has 
      seriously harmed Ethiopia's ecology and economy. To properly inform 
      decision-making about the control of this invasive species, it is crucial to 
      investigate the projected invasion dynamics of O. ficus-indica in the country 
      under the current climate change scenarios. Thus, the objective of this research 
      was to evaluate the current distribution and relative importance of environmental 
      variables for O. ficus-indica distribution, map the habitat's future suitability 
      under scenarios of climate change and assess how habitat change would affect the 
      species' future expected suitability in Ethiopia. The SDM R program was used to 
      perform species distribution modeling (SDM) using 311 georeferenced presence 
      records along with climatic variables. Predictive models were developed as an 
      agreement model from six modeling methodologies to investigate the climatic 
      suitability of target species for the years 2050 and 2070 under two shared 
      socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and 5-8.5) in order to estimate 
      the risks of climate change to the species. Under the current climatic scenario, 
      only 9.26% (104939.3 km(2)) and 4.05% (45850.6 km(2)) of the country were 
      moderately and highly suitable for species dispersion and invasion respectively. 
      The remaining 86.69% (980648 km(2)) was suitable for the distribution and 
      invasion of the species. In 2050, under the SSP2-4.5 and 5-8.5, the highly 
      suitable range of O. ficus-indica is anticipated to expand by 2.30% and 1.76%, 
      whereas the moderately suitable area is predicted to decrease by 1.66% and 2.69%, 
      respectively. Under the SSP2-4.5 and 5-8.5 scenarios, the highly suitable region 
      for the species is expected to grow by 1.47% and 0.65%, respectively, in 2070 
      compared to the current climatic conditions. This invasive species had already 
      had a considerable negative influence on rangelands in a significant portion of 
      the country with the current cover. Its continuing growth would exacerbate the 
      issue, cause significant economic and environmental harm, and endanger the 
      community's way of living. If preventive and efficient management methods are not 
      taken seriously, the species will have considerable negative environmental 
      impacts, which would be one of the biggest difficulties for pastoralism and their 
      livelihoods.

AB  - In this research work, an optimization of an environment friendly extraction 
      method of cactus (Opuntia ficus indica) cladode dietary fibers was conducted. For 
      this purpose, a central composite experimental design with two factors 
      (temperature and time) and five levels was established. The basic objective of 
      this optimization was to maximize fiber yield using hot water as an extraction 
      eco-solvent. The optimum extraction time (330 min) and temperature (100  degrees C) were 
      determined with a constant medium agitation rate. Additionally, this study also 
      aimed at establishing the validation of the statistical model to carry out the 
      extrapolation of the extraction process at the pilot scale. The fibers extracted 
      at the pilot scale showed yields (45.2 +/- 0.01%) in agreement with those obtained 
      through the optimization and validation lab-scale steps (44.97 +/- 0.02). Fourier 
      Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning 
      electron microscopy (SEM) analysis were conducted to investigate the structure 
      and microstructure of pilot scale-produced fibers. FTIR spectrum and XRD pattern 
      were typical to lignocellulosic fibers results. Sharp and thin peaks 
      characteristic of cellulose were detected. Pure and crystallized phases were 
      recorded with a 45% crystallinity index. SEM analysis presented elongated and 
      organized cells with a uniform structure comparable to cellulosic fibers 
      microstructure.

TI  - Vinegar production via spontaneous fermentation of different prickly pear fruit 
      matrices: changes in chemical composition and biological activities.
PG  - 5221-5230
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.12605 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study focused on the valorization of prickly pear (PP) fruit 
      (Opuntia ficus-indica) into vinegar by spontaneous surface fermentation on 
      different starting matrices (with/without the addition of sucrose and 
      with/without PP peel in the raw material). Different parameters were monitored 
      during the fermentation process in terms of their physicochemical and biological 
      properties. RESULTS: Physicochemical and phytochemical analysis revealed 
      significant differences depending on the starting matrix. An increase in total 
      phenolic content (TPC) was observed for the majority of samples when transformed 
      from PP juice into PP vinegar revealing the role of fermentation in enhancing the 
      bioactive compounds content. Better antioxidant and antibacterial activity were 
      detected for vinegar samples compared with the initial starting matrix. Using 
      whole PP fruit resulted in better TPC and antioxidant activity; in contrast, 
      sugar addition had no significant effect on any studied data. Analysis of 
      variance, taking into account the four factors that were studied (matrix, 
      variety, with/without peel, and with/without sugar), demonstrated that only the 
      factor 'presence or absence of the peel' had a significant influence on the TPC 
      values. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that both whole PP fruit and PP juice 
      could be used as new raw materials for vinegar production. (c) 2023 Society of

AB  - This work reports a combined coagulation-electrocoagulation process using a 
      biocoagulant from the Opuntia ficus-indica for treatment of cheese whey 
      wastewater. The process parameters as pH, biocoagulant dosage, and current 
      density were evaluated from the chemometric tools. A Box-Behnken design was used, 
      having as responses the removal percentages of turbidity and chemical oxygen 
      demand (COD). The results showed that for the studied variable ranges, linear 
      models were obtained and the pH was parameter more significant for treatment 
      proposed. The pH showed synergic effect with the investigated parameters, while 
      the biocoagulant dosage and density current showed antagonistic effects. The 
      desirability function was used to optimization of process, and suggested values 
      were pH 10.0, biocoagulant dosage of 4.4 g L(-1), and current density of 
      31.5 mA cm(-2), which showed removals of turbidity and COD of 98.9 and 83.8%, 
      respectively.

TI  - Characterization and anti-aging effects of Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller 
      extracts in a D-galactose-induced skin aging model.
PG  - 3107-3125
LID - 10.1039/d2fo03834j [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller (OFI), belonging to the family Cactaceae, is 
      widely cultivated not only for its delicious fruits but also for its 
      health-promoting effects, which enhance the role of OFI as a potential functional 
      food. In this study, the in vitro collagenase and elastase enzyme inhibitory 
      effects of extracts from different parts of OFI were evaluated. The most 
      promising extracts were formulated as creams at two concentrations (3 and 5%) to 
      investigate their effects on a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced skin-aging mouse 
      model. The ethanolic extracts of the peel and cladodes exhibited the highest 
      enzyme inhibitory effects. Cream made from the extract of OFI peel (OP) (5%) and 
      cream from OFI cladodes extract (OC) (5%) significantly decreased the macroscopic 
      aging of skin scores. Only a higher concentration (5%) of OC showed the 
      normalization of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) skin levels 
      and achieved significant improvements as compared to the vitamin E group. Both OC 
      and OP (5%) showed complete restoration of the normal skin structure and nearly 
      normal collagen fibres upon histopathological examination. The Ultra-Performance 
      Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) 
      metabolite profiles revealed the presence of organic acids, phenolic acids, 
      flavonoids, betalains, and fatty acids. Flavonoids were the predominant 
      phytochemical class (23 and 22 compounds), followed by phenolic acids (14 and 17 
      compounds) in the ethanolic extracts from the peel and cladodes, respectively. 
      The anti-skin-aging effects could be attributed to the synergism of different 
      phytochemicals in both extracts. From these findings, the OFI peel and cladodes 
      as agro-waste products are good candidates for anti-skin-aging phytocosmetics.

TI  - Landscape experiments unlock relationships among habitat loss, fragmentation, and 
      patch-size effects.
PG  - e4037
LID - 10.1002/ecy.4037 [doi]
AB  - Habitat loss is often considered the greatest near-term threat to biodiversity, 
      while the impact of habitat fragmentation remains intensely debated. A key issue 
      of this debate centers on the problem of scale-landscape or patch-at which to 
      assess the consequences of fragmentation. Yet patterns are often confounded 
      across scales, and experimental designs that could solve this scaling problem 
      remain scarce. We conducted two field experiments in 30 experimental landscapes 
      in which we manipulated habitat loss, fragmentation, and patch size for a 
      community of four insect herbivores that specialize on the cactus Opuntia. In the 
      first experiment, we destroyed 2088 Opuntia patches in either aggregated or 
      random patterns and compared the relative effects of landscape-scale loss and 
      fragmentation to those of local patch size on species occurrence. This experiment 
      focused on manipulating the relative separation of remaining patches, where we 
      hypothesized that aggregated loss would disrupt dispersal more than random loss, 
      leading to lower occurrence. In the second experiment, we destroyed 759 Opuntia 
      patches to generate landscapes that varied in patch number and size for a given 
      amount of habitat loss and assessed species occurrence. This experiment focused 
      on manipulating the subdivision of remaining habitat, where we hypothesized that 
      an increase in the number of patches for a given amount of loss would lead to 
      negative effects on occurrence. For both, we expected that occurrence would 
      increase with patch size. We find strong evidence for landscape-scale effects of 
      habitat fragmentation, with aggregated loss and a larger number of patches for a 
      given amount of habitat loss leading to a lower frequency of patches occupied in 
      landscapes. In both experiments, occurrence increased with patch size, yet 
      interactions of patch size and landscape-scale loss and fragmentation drove 
      species occurrence in patches. Importantly, the direction of effects were 
      consistent across scales and effects of patch size were sufficient to predict the 
      effects of habitat loss and fragmentation across entire landscapes. Our 
      experimental results suggest that changes at both the patch and landscape scales 
      can impact populations, but that a long-standing pattern-the patch-size 
      effect-captures much of the key variation shaping patterns of species occurrence.

TI  - Synchrotron micro-computed tomography unveils the three-dimensional structure and 
      origin of staminodes in the Plains Prickly Pear Cactus Opuntia polyacantha Haw. 
      (Cactaceae).
PG  - 1303-1312

AB  - Floral appendages display an array of shapes and sizes. Among these organs, 
      staminodes are morphologically diverse structures that have lost the ability to 
      produce pollen, but in some instances, they produce fertile pollen grains. In the 
      family Cactaceae staminodes are uncommon and range from simple linear to flat to 
      spatulate structures, but studies describing their structural attributes are 
      scanty. This study highlights the advantages of synchrotron radiation for sample 
      preparation and as a research tool for plant biology. It describes the internal 
      morphology of floral parts, particularly stamen, tepal, and staminode in the 
      Plains Prickly Pear Cactus, Opuntia polyacantha, using synchrotron radiation 
      micro-computed tomography (SR-muCT). It also shows the different anatomical 
      features in reconstructed three-dimensional imaging of reproductive parts and 
      discuss the advantages of the segmentation method to detect and characterize the 
      configuration and intricate patterns of vascular networks and associated 
      structures of tepal and androecial parts applying SR-muCT. This powerful 
      technology led to substantial improvements in terms of resolution allowing a more 
      comprehensive understanding of the anatomical organization underlying the 
      vasculature of floral parts and inception of staminodes in O. polyacantha. Tepal 
      and androecial parts have uniseriate epidermis enclosing loose mesophyll with 
      mucilage secretory ducts, lumen, and scattered vascular bundles. Cryptic 
      underlying structural attributes provide evidence of a vascularized pseudo-anther 
      conjoint with tepals. The undefined contours of staminodial appendages 
      (pseudo-anther) amalgamated to the tepals' blurred boundaries suggest that 
      staminodes originate from tepals, a developmental pattern supporting the fading 
      border model of floral organ identity for angiosperms.

TI  - Dactylopius opuntiae (Hemiptera: Dactylopiidae) as a Diet Source for Mass Rearing 
      Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (Coleoptera: Coccinelidae).
PG  - 485-492
LID - 10.1007/s13744-022-01018-w [doi]
AB  - Although natural enemies play an important role in most integrated pest 
      management programs, biological control agents remain poorly adopted in food 
      production systems primarily due to the high costs associated with their 
      implementation. Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (Mulsant, 1853) is a very promising 
      candidate for the biological control of mealybugs. However, mass rearing of this 
      predator is critical to provide sufficient numbers so that effective control of 
      mealybugs can be achieved. Thus, this work focuses on mass rearing of this 
      biological control agent under controlled conditions at T = 28 +/- 1  degrees C, 
      RH = 70 +/- 5%, and 12:12-h photoperiod L:D. This experiment was based on feeding 
      this predator three diets: a freeze-dried artificial food source, the cactus 
      cochineal-Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockerell, 1929), and a combination of the two 
      diets. The fecundity recorded in the freeze-dried artificial food, D. opuntiae, 
      and mixed diet was 2.73, 8.79, and 8.78 larvae/female, respectively. The sex 
      ratios (male:female) of the cochineal adults that emerged on the three diets were 
      1:1.35, 1:1.23, and 1:1.11, respectively, for the freeze-dried artificial food, 
      D. opuntiae, and mixed diet. The emerged adults had an average weight of 9.2 mg 
      when fed the artificial diet, 13.8 mg for the D. opuntiae diet, and 9.5 mg for 
      the mixed diet, while the life cycle duration for each diet was 50.1, 43.5, and 
      42.3 d, respectively. At the beginning of the C. montrouzieri rearing process 
      with 40 adults, our results indicated that an average of 1031.1 adults can be 
      produced using D. opuntiae as the diet in a volume of 1 m(3). The D. opuntiae 
      diet is recommended due to its overall lower costs. Additionally, this study 
      indicates that mass-rearing of C. montrouzieri can be achieved with cheaper and 
      more readily available materials for diets, instead of purchasing a freeze-dried 
      artificial food source.

AB  - Cactaceae family is well-known for their adaptations to drought and arid 
      environments. This family, formed by four subfamilies (Cactoideae, Opuntioideae, 
      Pereskioideae, and Maihuenioideae) are known for being leafless stem succulent 
      plants with numerous spines, and their commercial fruits, distinguished by their 
      bright colors and their skin covered with bracts. Some of these species have been 
      traditionally used in the food industry (e.g., pitaya, cactus, or prickly pear) 
      or as pharmaceuticals to treat specific diseases due to their active properties. 
      The processing of these fruits leads to different residues, namely pomace, skin, 
      spines, and residues from cladodes; besides from others such as fruits, roots, 
      flowers, mucilage, and seeds. In general, Cactaceae species produce large amounts 
      of mucilage and fiber, although they can be also considered as a source of 
      phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, flavonols and their glycosides), alkaloids 
      (phenethylamines derived betalains), and triterpenoids. Therefore, considering 
      their high content in fiber and fermentable carbohydrates, together with other 
      target bioactive compounds, fermentation is a potential valorization strategy for 
      certain applications such as enzymes and bioactive compounds production or aroma 
      enhancement. This review will comprise the latest information about Cactaceae

AB  - This study investigated the phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of fruit 
      extracts of Opuntia dillenii (Ker Gawl.) Haw.(OD) and Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) 
      Mill.(OFI), yellow (F1) and red (F2) varieties. In order to evaluate the 
      antioxidant activity of these extracts on human sperm quality after thawing, the 
      semen parameters (vitality, motility, acrosome reaction, oxidative stress, and 
      DNA fragmentation) were analysed after 1 h of exposure. The results showed that 
      OD has higher phenolic content and antioxidant power than OFI, and that they are 
      higher in F2 than F1. Furthermore, regarding the activity of extracts on thawed 
      sperm, the results showed a significant increase in motility in samples treated 
      with OFI F1 and OD extracts, while an improvement in vitality and acrosome 
      reaction and a reduction of DNA fragmentation were observed in all exposed 
      samples compared to the control. Finally, a reduction of oxidative stress was 
      observed in samples exposed to OFI F2 and OD than control.

AB  - Opuntia monacantha is a Cactaceae found in regions with few nutrients and water. 
      This study aimed to identify bioactive compounds in the fruit of O. monacantha in 
      the southern region of Brazil. In the fruit of O. monacantha, five phenolic 
      compounds were identified: protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, 
      catechin and quercetin. The ferulic acid and catechin were found in higher 
      concentration in the fruit. The terpenes alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, oleanolic acid and 
      cycloartenol were also identified in the hexane fractions of the fruit. 
      Unsaturated fatty acids were found in the fruit seed, with the highest 
      concentration of linoleic acid (69.0%).

AB  - In the last years, the use of natural phytochemical compounds as protective 
      agents in the prevention and treatment of obesity and the related-metabolic 
      syndrome has gained much attention worldwide. Different studies have shown health 
      benefits for many vegetables such Opuntia ficus-indica and Beta vulgaris and 
      their pigments collectively referred as betalains. Betalains exert antioxidative, 
      anti-inflammation, lipid lowering, antidiabetic and anti-obesity effects. This 
      review summarizes findings in the literature and highlights the therapeutic 
      potential of betalains and their natural source as valid alternative for 
      supplementation in obesity-related disorders treatment. Further research is 
      needed to establish the mechanisms through which these natural pigments exert 
      their beneficial effects and to translate the promising findings from animal 
      models to humans.

TI  - The heat-stable protein fraction from Opuntia ficus-indica seeds exhibits an 
      enzyme protective effect against thermal denaturation and an antibacterial 
      activity.
PG  - 593-602
LID - 10.1002/bab.2382 [doi]
AB  - Desiccation tolerance in developing seeds occurs through several mechanisms among 
      which, a common group of proteins named dehydrins has received considerable 
      attention. So far, there is no information dealing with the accumulation of 
      dehydrins in seeds of Opuntia ficus-indica. We have initiated here an extraction 
      protocol based on two critical steps: heat and acid treatments, and the purity of 
      this fraction was analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. Western blot analysis of the 
      heat-stable protein fraction (HSF) revealed two main bands of approximately 45 
      and 44 kDa, while three others of  approximately 40, 32, and 31 kDa were faintly visible, which 
      were recognized by anti-dehydrin antibodies. This fraction exhibited a Cu(2+) 
      -dependent resistance to protease treatments. Next, we performed a series of 
      assays to compare the functional properties of the HSF with those of the 
      previously characterized wheat dehydrin (DHN-5). Antibacterial assays revealed 
      that HSF exhibits only moderate antibacterial activities against gram-negative 
      and gram-positive bacteria, with a minimum inhibition concentration ranging from 
      0.25 to 1 mg/ml. However, in vitro assays revealed that compared to DHN-5, HSF 
      exhibits higher protective activities of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) when 
      exposed to heat, freezing, and dehydration stresses. The protective role of HSF 
      seems to be linked to its best ability to minimize protein aggregation.

      development by inducing an axenic midgut environment.
PG  - e21872
LID - 10.1002/arch.21872 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of acute exposure of Aedes aegypti third instar 
      (L(3) ) larvae to the saline extract of Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes on the 
      biological cycle and fertility of the emerging adults. For this, larvae were 
      treated for 24 h with the extract at (1/4) LC(50) (lethal concentration to kill 50% 
      of larvae), (1/2) LC(50) or LC(50) ; the development and reproduction of the emerged 
      adults were evaluated after a recovery period of 9 days. The resistance of 
      proteins in the extract to hydrolysis by L(3) digestive enzymes and 
      histomorphological alterations in the larval midgut were also investigated. The 
      extract contained lectin, flavonoids, cinnamic derivatives, terpenes, steroids, 
      and reducing sugars. It showed a LC(50) of 3.71% for 48 h. The data indicated 
      mean survival times similar in control and extract treatments. It was observed 
      development delay in extract-treated groups, with a lower number of adults than 
      in control. However, the females that emerged laid similar number of eggs in 
      control and treatments. Histological evaluation revealed absence of bacterial and 
      fungal microorganisms in the food content in midguts from larvae treated with 
      cladode extract. Electrophoresis revealed that three polypeptides in the extract 
      resisted to hydrolysis by L(3) digestive proteases for 90 min. The lectin 
      activity was not altered even after 24-h incubation with the enzymes. In 
      conclusion, the extract from O. ficus-indica can delay the development of Ae. 
      aegypti larvae, which may be linked to induction of an axenic environment at 
      larval midgut and permanence of lectin activity even after proteolysis.
